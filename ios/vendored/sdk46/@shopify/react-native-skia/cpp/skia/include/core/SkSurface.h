/** \class SkSurface
    SkSurface is responsible for managing the pixels that a canvas draws into. The pixels can be
    allocated either in CPU memory (a raster surface) or on the GPU (a GrRenderTarget surface).
    SkSurface takes care of allocating a SkCanvas that will draw into the surface. Call
    surface->getCanvas() to use that canvas (but don't delete it, it is owned by the surface).
    SkSurface always has non-zero dimensions. If there is a request for a new surface, and either
    of the requested dimensions are zero, then nullptr will be returned.
