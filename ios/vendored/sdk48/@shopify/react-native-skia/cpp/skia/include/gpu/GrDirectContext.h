     * skgpu::MutableTextureState. All objects that wrap the backend surface (i.e. SkSurfaces and
     * SkImages) will also be aware of this state change. This call does not submit the state change
     * to the gpu, but requires the client to call `submit` to send it to the GPU. The work
     * for this call is ordered linearly with all other calls that require GrContext::submit to be
     * called (e.g updateBackendTexture and flush). If finishedProc is not null then it will be
     * called with finishedContext after the state transition is known to have occurred on the GPU.
     *
     * See skgpu::MutableTextureState to see what state can be set via this call.
     *
     * If the backend API is Vulkan, the caller can set the skgpu::MutableTextureState's
     * VkImageLayout to VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED or queueFamilyIndex to VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED to
     * tell Skia to not change those respective states.
     *
     * If previousState is not null and this returns true, then Skia will have filled in
     * previousState to have the values of the state before this call.

    //
    // Steps to use this API:
    //
    // 1) Create a GrDirectContext as normal, but set fPersistentCache on GrContextOptions to
    //    something that will save the cached shader blobs. Set fShaderCacheStrategy to kSkSL. This
    //    will ensure that the blobs are SkSL, and are suitable for pre-compilation.
    // 2) Run your application, and save all of the key/data pairs that are fed to the cache.
    //
    // 3) Switch over to shipping your application. Include the key/data pairs from above.
    // 4) At startup (or any convenient time), call precompileShader for each key/data pair.
    //    This will compile the SkSL to create a GL program, and populate the runtime cache.
    //
    // This is only guaranteed to work if the context/device used in step #2 are created in the
    // same way as the one used in step #4, and the same GrContextOptions are specified.
    // Using cached shader blobs on a different device or driver are undefined.
