#
#  This script is meant to be run as a Run Script in the "Build Phases" section
#  of your Xcode project. It sends debug symbols to symbolicate stacktraces,
#  sends build events to track versions, and onboard apps for Crashlytics.
#
#  This script calls upload-symbols twice:
#
#  1) First it calls upload-symbols synchronously in "validation" mode. If the
#     script finds issues with the build environment, it will report errors to Xcode.
#     In validation mode it exits before doing any time consuming work.
#
#  2) Then it calls upload-symbols in the background to actually send the build
#     event and upload symbols. It does this in the background so that it doesn't
#     slow down your builds. If an error happens here, you won't see it in Xcode.
#
#  You can find the output for the background execution in Console.app, by
#  searching for "upload-symbols".
#
#  If you want verbose output, you can pass the --debug flag to this script
#

#  Figure out where we're being called from
