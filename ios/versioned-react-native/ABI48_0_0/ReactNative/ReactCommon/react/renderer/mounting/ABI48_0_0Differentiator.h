/**
 * During differ, we need to keep some `ShadowViewNodePair`s in memory.
 * Some `ShadowViewNodePair`s are referenced from std::vectors returned
 * by `sliceChildShadowNodeViewPairsV2`; some are referenced in TinyMaps
 * for view (un)flattening especially; and it is not always clear which
 * std::vectors will outlive which TinyMaps, and vice-versa, so it doesn't
 * make sense for the std::vector or TinyMap to own any `ShadowViewNodePair`s.
 *
 * Thus, we introduce the concept of a scope.
 *
 * For the duration of some operation, we keep a ViewNodePairScope around, such
 * that: (1) the ViewNodePairScope keeps each
 * ShadowViewNodePair alive, (2) we have a stable pointer value that we can
 * use to reference each ShadowViewNodePair (not guaranteed with std::vector,
 * for example, which may have to resize and move values around).
 *
 * As long as we only manipulate the data-structure with push_back, std::deque
 * both (1) ensures that pointers into the data-structure are never invalidated,
 * and (2) tries to efficiently allocate storage such that as many objects as
 * possible are close in memory, but does not guarantee adjacency.
