**`expo-location`** allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-location" />

## Configuration

In Managed and bare apps, `Location` requires `Permissions.LOCATION`.

In order to use [Background Location Methods](#background-location-methods), the following requirements apply:

- `Permissions.LOCATION` permission must be granted. On iOS it must be granted with `Always` option — see [Permissions.LOCATION](permissions.md#permissionslocation) for more details.
- `"location"` background mode must be specified in **Info.plist** file. See [background tasks configuration guide](task-manager.md#configuration). **(_iOS only_)**
- Background location task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [TaskManager.defineTask](task-manager.md#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-task).

In order to use [Geofencing Methods](#geofencing-methods), the following requirements apply:

- `Permissions.LOCATION` permission must be granted. On iOS it must be granted with `Always` option — see [Permissions.LOCATION](permissions.md#permissionslocation) for more details.
- Geofencing task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [TaskManager.defineTask](task-manager.md#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-task).
- On iOS, there is a [limit of 20](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) `regions` that can be simultaneously monitored.

On Android, This module requires the permissions for approximate and exact device location. It also needs the foreground service permission to subscribe to location updates, while the app is in use. The `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permissions are automatically added.

## Usage

If you're using the iOS or Android Emulators, ensure that [Location is enabled](#enabling-emulator-location).

## API

```js
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
```

## Methods

### `Location.hasServicesEnabledAsync()`

Checks whether location services are enabled by the user.

#### Returns

A promise resolving to `true` if location services are enabled on the device, or `false` if not.

### `Location.requestPermissionsAsync()`

> **Deprecated.** Use [`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) or [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync).

Asks the user to grant permissions for location.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [LocationPermissionResponse](#locationpermissionresponse).

### `Location.getPermissionsAsync()`

> **Deprecated.** Use [`getForegroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationgetforegroundpermissionsasync) or [`getBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationgetbackgroundpermissionsasync).

Checks user's permissions for accessing location.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [LocationPermissionResponse](#locationpermissionresponse).

### `Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()`

Asks the user to grant permissions for location while the app is in the foreground.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [PermissionResponse](permissions.md#permissionresponse).

### `Location.getForegroundPermissionsAsync()`

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the foreground.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [PermissionResponse](permissions.md#permissionresponse).

### `Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`

Asks the user to grant permissions for location while the app is in the background.
On **Android 11 or higher**: this method will open the system settings page - before that happens you should explain to the user why your application needs background location permission. For example, you can use `Modal` component from `react-native` to do that.

> **Note**: Foreground permissions should be granted before asking for the background permissions (your app can't obtain background permission without foreground permission).

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [PermissionResponse](permissions.md#permissionresponse).

### `Location.getBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the background.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves to an object of type [PermissionResponse](permissions.md#permissionresponse).

### `Location.getLastKnownPositionAsync(options)`

Gets the last known position of the device. It's considered to be faster than `getCurrentPositionAsync` as it doesn't request for the current location, but keep in mind the returned location may not be up-to-date.

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** — A map of options:
  - **maxAge (_number_)** — A number of milliseconds after which the last known location starts to be invalid and thus `null` is returned.
  - **requiredAccuracy (_number_)** — The maximum radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters. If the last known location's accuracy radius is bigger (less accurate) then `null` is returned.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to an object of type [LocationObject](#locationobject) or `null` if it's not available or doesn't match given requirements such as maximum age or required accuracy.

### `Location.getCurrentPositionAsync(options)`

Requests for one-time delivery of the user's current location. Depending on given `accuracy` option it may take some time to resolve, especially when you're inside a building.

> **Note:** Calling it causes the location manager to obtain a location fix which may take several seconds. Consider using [Location.getLastKnownPositionAsync](#locationgetlastknownpositionasyncoptions) if you expect to get a quick response and high accuracy is not required.

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** — A map of options:
  - **accuracy : [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy)** — Location manager accuracy. Pass one of [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy) enum values. For low-accuracy the implementation can avoid geolocation providers that consume a significant amount of power (such as GPS).

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to an object of type [LocationObject](#locationobject).

### `Location.watchPositionAsync(options, callback)`

Subscribe to location updates from the device. Please note that updates will only occur while the application is in the foreground. To get location updates while in background you'll need to use [Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync](#locationstartlocationupdatesasynctaskname-options).

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** — A map of options:

  - **accuracy : [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy)** — Location manager accuracy. Pass one of [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy) enum values. For low accuracy the implementation can avoid geolocation providers that consume a significant amount of power (such as GPS).
  - **timeInterval (_number_)** — Minimum time to wait between each update in milliseconds.
  - **distanceInterval (_number_)** — Receive updates only when the location has changed by at least this distance in meters.
  - **mayShowUserSettingsDialog (_boolean_)** — (**Android only**) Specifies whether to ask the user to turn on improved accuracy location mode which uses Wi-Fi, cell networks and GPS sensor. The dialog can be shown only when the location mode is set to **Device only**. Defaults to `true`.

- **callback (_function_)** -- This function is called on each location update. It receives an object of type [LocationObject](#locationobject) as the first argument.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to a subscription object, which has one field:

- **remove (_function_)** -- Call this function with no arguments to remove this subscription. The callback will no longer be called for location updates.

### `Location.getProviderStatusAsync()`

Check status of location providers.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to an object of type [LocationProviderStatus](#locationproviderstatus).

### `Location.enableNetworkProviderAsync()`

Asks the user to turn on high accuracy location mode which enables network provider that uses Google Play services to improve location accuracy and location-based services.

#### Returns

A promise resolving as soon as the user accepts the dialog. Rejects if denied.

### `Location.getHeadingAsync()`

Gets the current heading information from the device

#### Returns

A promise resolving to an object of type [LocationHeadingObject](#locationheadingobject).

### `Location.watchHeadingAsync(callback)`

Subscribe to compass updates from the device.

#### Arguments

- **callback (_function_)** -- This function is called on each compass update. It receives an object of type [LocationHeadingObject](#locationheadingobject) as the first argument.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to a subscription object, which has one field:

- **remove (_function_)** — Call this function with no arguments to remove this subscription. The callback will no longer be called for location updates.

### `Location.geocodeAsync(address)`

Geocode an address string to latitude-longitude location.

> **Note**: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.
>
> On Android, you must request a location permission (`Permissions.LOCATION`) from the user before geocoding can be used.

#### Arguments

- **address (_string_)** — A string representing address, eg. "Baker Street London"
- **options (_object_)** — A map of options:
  - **useGoogleMaps (_boolean_)** — Whether to force using Google Maps API instead of the native implementation. Used by default only on Web platform. Requires providing an API key by `setGoogleApiKey`.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to an array (in most cases its size is 1) of geocoded location objects with the following fields:

- **latitude (_number_)** — The latitude in degrees.
- **longitude (_number_)** — The longitude in degrees.
- **altitude (_number_)** — The altitude in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid.
- **accuracy (_number_)** — The radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters.

### `Location.reverseGeocodeAsync(location)`

Reverse geocode a location to postal address.

> **Note**: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.
>
> On Android, you must request a location permission (`Permissions.LOCATION`) from the user before geocoding can be used.

#### Arguments

- **location (_object_)** — An object representing a location:
  - **latitude (_number_)** — The latitude of location to reverse geocode, in degrees.
  - **longitude (_number_)** — The longitude of location to reverse geocode, in degrees.
- **options (_object_)** — A map of options:
  - **useGoogleMaps (_boolean_)** — Whether to force using Google Maps API instead of the native implementation. Used by default only on Web platform. Requires providing an API key by `setGoogleApiKey`.

#### Returns

Returns a promise resolving to an array (in most cases its size is 1) of address objects with following fields:

- **city (_string_ | _null_)** — City name of the address.
- **district (_string_ | _null_)** — Additional city-level information like district name.
- **street (_string_ | _null_)** — Street name of the address.
- **region (_string_ | _null_)** — The state or province associated with the address.

- **country (_string_ | _null_)** — Localized country name of the address.
- **name (_string_ | _null_)** — The name of the placemark, for example, "Tower Bridge".
- **isoCountryCode (_string_ | _null_)** — Localized (iso) country code of the address, if available.
- **timezone (_string_ | _null_)** — The timezone identifier associated with the address. (**iOS only**)

### `Location.setGoogleApiKey(apiKey)`

Sets a Google API Key for using Google Maps Geocoding API which is used by default on Web platform and can be enabled through `useGoogleMaps` option of `geocodeAsync` and `reverseGeocodeAsync` methods. It might be useful for Android devices that do not have Google Play Services, hence no Geocoder Service.

#### Arguments

- **apiKey (_string_)** — Google API key obtained from Google API Console. This API key must have `Geocoding API` enabled, otherwise your geocoding requests will be denied.

### `Location.installWebGeolocationPolyfill()`

Polyfills `navigator.geolocation` for interop with the core React Native and Web API approach to geolocation.

## Background Location Methods

The Background Location API can notify your app about new locations while your app is backgrounded. Make sure you've followed the required steps detailed [here](#configuration).

> **Note:** on Android, you have to [submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150?hl=en).

### `Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync(taskName, options)`

Registers for receiving location updates that can also come when the app is in the background.

#### Arguments

- **taskName (_string_)** -- Name of the task receiving location updates.
- **options (_object_)** -- An object of options passed to the location manager.
  - **accuracy : [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy)** -- Location manager accuracy. Pass one of [LocationAccuracy](#locationaccuracy) enum values. For low-accuracy the implementation can avoid geolocation providers that consume a significant amount of power (such as GPS).
  - **timeInterval (_number_)** -- Minimum time to wait between each update in milliseconds. Default value depends on `accuracy` option. (**Android only**)
  - **distanceInterval (_number_)** -- Receive updates only when the location has changed by at least this distance in meters. Default value may depend on `accuracy` option.
  - **deferredUpdatesInterval (_number_)** -- Minimum time interval in milliseconds that must pass since last reported location before all later locations are reported in a batched update. Defaults to `0`.
  - **deferredUpdatesDistance (_number_)** -- The distance in meters that must occur between last reported location and the current location before deferred locations are reported. Defaults to `0`.
  - **showsBackgroundLocationIndicator (_boolean_)** -- A boolean indicating whether the status bar changes its appearance when location services are used in the background. Defaults to `false`. (**Takes effect only on iOS 11.0 and later**)
  - **foregroundService (_object_)** -- Use this option to put the location service into a foreground state, which will make location updates in the background as frequent as in the foreground state. As a downside, it requires a sticky notification, so the user will be aware that your app is running and consumes more resources even if backgrounded. (**Available since Android 8.0**)
    - **notificationTitle (_string_)** -- Title of the foreground service notification. _required_
    - **notificationBody (_string_)** -- Subtitle of the foreground service notification. _required_
    - **notificationColor (_string_)** -- Color of the foreground service notification. Accepts `#RRGGBB` and `#AARRGGBB` hex formats. _optional_
  - **pausesUpdatesAutomatically (_boolean_)** -- A boolean value indicating whether the location manager can pause location updates to improve battery life without sacrificing location data. When this option is set to `true`, the location manager pauses updates (and powers down the appropriate hardware) at times when the location data is unlikely to change. You can help the determination of when to pause location updates by assigning a value to the `activityType` property. Defaults to `false`. (**iOS only**)
  - **activityType : [LocationActivityType](#locationactivitytype)** -- The type of user activity associated with the location updates. See [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1620567-activitytype) for more details. Defaults to `LocationActivityType.Other`. (**iOS only**)

> Deferred updates provide a way to report locations in a batch when the app is in the background state. Location updates aren't being deferred in the foreground.

#### Returns

A promise resolving once the task with location updates is registered.

#### Task parameters

Background location task will be receiving following data:

- **locations : [LocationObject](#locationobject)[]** - An array of the new locations.

```javascript
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

TaskManager.defineTask(YOUR_TASK_NAME, ({ data: { locations }, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    // check `error.message` for more details.
    return;
  }
  console.log('Received new locations', locations);
});
```

### `Location.stopLocationUpdatesAsync(taskName)`

## Geofencing Methods

Geofencing API notifies your app when the device enters or leaves geographical regions you set up.
To make it work in the background, it uses [TaskManager](task-manager.md) Native API under the hood. Make sure you've followed the required steps detailed [here](#configuration).

> **Note:** on Android, you have to [submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150?hl=en).

### `Location.startGeofencingAsync(taskName, regions)`

Starts geofencing for given regions. When the new event comes, the task with specified name will be called with the region that the device enter to or exit from.
If you want to add or remove regions from already running geofencing task, you can just call `startGeofencingAsync` again with the new array of regions.

#### Arguments

- **taskName (_string_)** -- Name of the task that will be called when the device enters or exits from specified regions.
- **regions (_array_)** -- Array of region objects to be geofenced.

  - **latitude (_number_)** -- The latitude in degrees of region's center point. _required_
  - **longitude (_number_)** -- The longitude in degrees of region's center point. _required_
  - **radius (_number_)** -- The radius measured in meters that defines the region's outer boundary. _required_
  - **notifyOnEnter (_boolean_)** -- Boolean value whether to call the task if the device enters the region. Defaults to `true`.
  - **notifyOnExit (_boolean_)** -- Boolean value whether to call the task if the device exits the region. Defaults to `true`.

#### Returns

A promise resolving as soon as the task is registered.

#### Task parameters

Geofencing task will be receiving following data:

- **eventType : [LocationGeofencingEventType](#locationgeofencingeventtype)** -- Indicates the reason for calling the task, which can be triggered by entering or exiting the region. See [LocationGeofencingEventType](#locationgeofencingeventtype).
- **region : [LocationRegion](#locationregion)** -- Object containing details about updated region. See [LocationRegion](#locationregion) for more details.

```javascript
import { LocationGeofencingEventType } from 'expo-location';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

TaskManager.defineTask(YOUR_TASK_NAME, ({ data: { eventType, region }, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    // check `error.message` for more details.
    return;
  }
  if (eventType === LocationGeofencingEventType.Enter) {
    console.log("You've entered region:", region);
  } else if (eventType === LocationGeofencingEventType.Exit) {
    console.log("You've left region:", region);
  }
});
```

### `Location.stopGeofencingAsync(taskName)`

Stops geofencing for specified task. It unregisters the background task so the app will not be receiving any updates, especially in the background.

#### Arguments

If you don't receive the locations in the emulator, you may have to turn off "Improve Location Accuracy" in Settings - Location in the emulator. This will turn off Wi-Fi location and only use GPS. Then you can manipulate the location with GPS data through the emulator.
