**`expo-constants`** provides system information that remains constant throughout the lifetime of your app's install.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-constants" />

## API

```js
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
```

## Properties

### `Constants.appOwnership`

Returns `expo`, `standalone`, or `guest`. This property only applies to the managed workflow and classic builds; for apps built with EAS Build and in bare workflow, the result is always `null`.

- `expo`: The experience is running inside of the Expo Go app.
- `standalone`: It is a [standalone app](../../../distribution/building-standalone-apps.md#building-standalone-apps).
- `guest`: It has been opened through a link from a standalone app.

### `Constants.deviceName`

A human-readable name for the device type.

### `Constants.deviceYearClass`

The [device year class](https://github.com/facebook/device-year-class) of this device.

### `Constants.expoVersion`

The version string of the Expo Go app currently running.

### `Constants.getWebViewUserAgentAsync()`

Gets the user agent string which would be included in requests sent by a web view running on this device. This is probably not the same user agent you might be providing in your JS `fetch` requests.

### `Constants.installationId`

> ⚠️ **This property is deprecated and will be removed in SDK 44. Please implement it on your own using `expo-application`'s [`androidId`](application.md#applicationandroidid) on Android and a storage API such as [`expo-secure-store`](securestore.md) on iOS and `localStorage` on Web.**

An identifier that is unique to this particular device and whose lifetime is at least as long as the installation of the app.

### `Constants.isDevice`

`true` if the app is running on a device, `false` if running in a simulator or emulator.

### `Constants.manifest`

The [manifest](/workflow/expo-go#manifest) object for the app.

### `Constants.nativeAppVersion`

The **Info.plist** value for `CFBundleShortVersionString` on iOS and the version name set by `version` in app.json on Android at the time the native app was built.

### `Constants.nativeBuildVersion`

The **Info.plist** value for `CFBundleVersion` on iOS (set with `ios.buildNumber` value in **app.json** in a standalone app) and the version code set by `android.versionCode` in app.json on Android at the time the native app was built.

### `Constants.platform`

- `ios`

  - `buildNumber`

    The build number specified in the embedded **Info.plist** value for `CFBundleVersion` in this app.
    In a standalone app, you can set this with the `ios.buildNumber` value in **app.json**. This
    may differ from the value in `Constants.manifest.ios.buildNumber` because the manifest
    can be updated, whereas this value will never change for a given native binary.
    The value is set to `null` in case you run your app in Expo Go.

  - `platform`

    The Apple internal model identifier for this device, e.g. `iPhone1,1`.

  - `model`

  The human-readable model name of this device, e.g. `"iPhone 7 Plus"` if it can be determined, otherwise will be `null`.

  - `userInterfaceIdiom`

  The user interface idiom of this device, i.e. whether the app is running on an iPhone or an iPad. Current supported values are `handset` and `tablet`. Apple TV and CarPlay will show up as `unsupported`.

  - `systemVersion`

  The version of iOS running on this device, e.g. `10.3`.

- `android`

  - `versionCode`

    The version code set by `android.versionCode` in app.json.
    The value is set to `null` in case you run your app in Expo Go.

### `Constants.sessionId`

A string that is unique to the current session of your app. It is different across apps and across multiple launches of the same app.

### `Constants.statusBarHeight`

The default status bar height for the device. Does not factor in changes when location tracking is in use or a phone call is active.

### `Constants.systemFonts`

A list of the system font names available on the current device.
