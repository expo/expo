title: ART

This library has been removed as of SDK 36. You likely want to use [Svg](svg.md) which is more feature complete, has better documentation, and is a more standard implementation of vector graphics.

If you need to use [react-native-progress](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-progress), which relies on ART, you can use the bare workflow and install [`@react-native-community/art`](https://github.com/react-native-community/art), or implement your own progress indicator using Svg ([here's an example](https://github.com/bartgryszko/react-native-circular-progress)).

**Again, you almost definitely want to use [Svg](svg.md) instead of this unless you are really sure you want to use ART for some reason.**
