Expo includes support for payments through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) on iOS via ExpoKit, and Stripe on Android (plus Android Pay via ExpoKit).

Need more help than what's on the page? The Payments module is largely based off [tipsi-stripe](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-stripe). The documentation and questions there may prove helpful.

_Note_: (Android only) If you are using Expo client then the setup has already been done for you.

```js
import { PaymentsStripe } from 'expo-payments-stripe';
```

<PlatformsSection android ios simulator web={{ pending: 'https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/4046' }} />

## Setup

If you haven't done payments with Stripe before, create an account with [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). After getting the account set up, navigate to the [Stripe API dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys). Here, you'll need to make a note of the Publishable key and Secret key listed.

## Adding the Payments Module on iOS

The Payments module is currently only supported through `EXPaymentsStripe` pod on iOS.

First, eject your Expo project using ExpoKit (refer to [Eject to ExpoKit](../../../expokit/eject.md) for more information). Then, add `expo-payments-stripe` to the list of dependencies of your project and install the dependencies. Then, navigate to and open `your-project-name/ios/Podfile`. Add `EXPaymentsStripe` to your Podfile's subspecs. Example:

```ruby
...
target 'your-project-name' do
  ...

  pod 'EXPaymentsStripe',
    :path => "../node_modules/expo-payments-stripe/ios",
    :inhibit_warnings => true

  ...
  pod 'React',
  ...
```

Finally run `npx pod-install`, this will add the Payments module files to your project and the corresponding dependencies.

### Register hook in order to let Stripe process source authorization

> You don't need to make this step if you're not going to use [sources](https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios/sources).

Follow [Stripe instructions](https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios/sources#redirecting-your-customer).

## Adding the Payments Module on Android

_Note_: These steps are required only if you have ejected your app with SDK < 30. If at the moment of ejecting you had `sdkVersion` set to 30 or higher in your `app.json`, the following setup should have been performed automatically.

1.  Add these lines into your settings.gradle file.

```groovy
include ':expo-payments-stripe'
project(':expo-payments-stripe').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/expo-payments-stripe/android')
```

2.  Add dependencies in your build.gradle file.

```groovy
implementation project(':expo-payments-stripe')
```

3.  Force specific `com.android.support:design` version in your `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
  android {
    ...
    configurations.all {
      resolutionStrategy.force 'com.android.support:design:27.1.0'
    }
    ...
  }
```

4.  Exclude old version of `CreditCardEntry` in `your-project/android/app/build.gradle` file.

```groovy
    implementation('host.exp.exponent:expoview:29.0.0@aar') {
      transitive = true
      exclude group: 'com.squareup.okhttp3', module: 'okhttp'
      exclude group: 'com.github.thefuntasty', module: 'CreditCardEntry' // add this line
      exclude group: 'com.squareup.okhttp3', module: 'okhttp-urlconnection'
    }
```

5.  Make sure your list of repositories in `build.gradle` contains `jitpack`.

```groovy
    allprojects {
      repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
        ...
      }
    }
```

### Register hook in order to let Stripe process source authorization

> You don't need to make this step if you're not going to use [sources](https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios/sources).

Add the following code to your `AndroidManifest.xml`, replacing `your_scheme` with the URI scheme you're going to use when specifying return URL for payment process.

```xml
      ...
      <activity
          android:exported="true"
          android:launchMode="singleTask"
          android:name="expo.modules.payments.stripe.RedirectUriReceiver"
          android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen">
          <intent-filter>
              <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
              <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
              <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

              <data android:scheme="your_scheme" />
          </intent-filter>
      </activity>
      ...
```

Remember to use the same scheme as the one which was set in `Info.plist` file (only if you are also developing app for iOS).

## Importing Payments

```javascript
import { PaymentsStripe as Stripe } from 'expo-payments-stripe';

...
Stripe.setOptionsAsync({
    ...
});
...
```

## Using the Payments SDK

First, initialize the Payments module with your credentials:

This `setOptionsAsync` method must put under the componentDidMount in android's production mode, unlike iOS that it works outside any component.

```javascript
Stripe.setOptionsAsync({
  publishableKey: 'PUBLISHABLE_KEY', // Your key
  androidPayMode: 'test', // [optional] used to set wallet environment (AndroidPay)
  merchantId: 'your_merchant_id', // [optional] used for payments with ApplePay
});
```

### Creating token [Android, iOS]

Creates token based on passed card params.

**params** — An object with the following keys:

## Creating source [Android, iOS]

Creates source object based on params. Sources are used to create payments for a variety of [payment methods](https://stripe.com/docs/sources)

_NOTE_: For sources that require redirecting your customer to authorize the payment, you need to specify a return URL when you create the source. This allows your customer to be redirected back to your app after they authorize the payment. The prefix before ':' in your return URL should be the same as the scheme in your `info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`. If You are not sure about this step look at above sections "Register hook in order to Stripe could process source authorization".

_NOTE_: If you are using Expo client or an ejected Expo application, do not specify `returnURL`.

```js
const items = [
  {
    label: 'Whisky',
    amount: '50.00',

    amount: '50.00',

  },
];

const options = {
  requiredBillingAddressFields: 'all',
  requiredShippingAddressFields: 'all',
  shippingMethods,

try {
  const token = await stripe.paymentRequestWithApplePayAsync(items, options);

  // Client specific code
  // api.sendTokenToBackend(token)

  // You should complete the operation by calling

} catch (error) {
  // Or cancel if an error occurred
  // stripe.cancelApplePayRequestAsync()
}
```

## Enabling Apple Pay in ExpoKit

If you want to use Apple Pay for payments, you'll need to set up your merchant ID in XCode first. Note that you do not need to go through this process to use the Payments module - you can still process payments with Stripe without going through the steps in this section.

If you haven't already, set up an Apple Merchant ID via the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/). Then, open the application in XCode and navigate to the capabilities tab. Enable Apple Pay and insert your merchant ID into the corresponding space.

Note: Apple Pay can be used only for real world items (ex. appeal, car sharing, food) and not virtual goods. For more information about proper usage of Apple Pay, visit Apple's [Apple Pay guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#apple-pay) and [Acceptable Use](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/acceptable-use-guidelines-for-websites/).
