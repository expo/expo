The `expo-updates` library allows you to programmatically control and respond to new updates made available to your app.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator />

## Installation

<APIInstallSection href="/bare/installing-updates/" />

## Usage

Most of the methods and constants in this module can only be used or tested in release mode; they do not make sense in debug builds where you always load the latest JavaScript from your computer while in development.

**To test manual updates in the Expo Go app**, run [`eas update`](/eas-update/introduction) and then open the published version of your app with Expo Go.

**To test manual updates with managed workflow standalone apps**, you can create a [simulator build](/build-reference/simulators.mdx) or [APK](/build-reference/apk.mdx), or make a release build locally with `expo run:ios --configuration Release` and `expo run:android --variant release`.

**To test manual updates in bare workflow apps**, make a release build with `expo run:ios --configuration Release` or `expo run:android --variant release` (you don't need to submit this build to the store to test).

## API

```js
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
```
