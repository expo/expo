Distributing your app to your users is a critical process in the development of any product. This documentation will cover topics related to app distribution, such as how to:

- [Create native builds](../building-standalone-apps/) you can submit to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- Prepare your app for [deployment to the App Store and Play Store](../app-stores/) and avoid common rejections.
- Manage different [release environments](../release-channels/) for your app
