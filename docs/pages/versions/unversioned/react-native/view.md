The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/flexbox), [style](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/style), [some touch handling](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/handling-touches), and [accessibility](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/accessibility) controls. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.

This example creates a `View` that wraps two boxes with color and a text component in a row with padding.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const ViewBoxesWithColorAndText = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flexDirection: 'row',
        height: 100,
        padding: 20,
      }}>
      <View style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', flex: 0.3 }} />
      <View style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', flex: 0.5 }} />
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default ViewBoxesWithColorAndText;
```

> `View`s are designed to be used with [`StyleSheet`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/style) for clarity and performance, although inline styles are also supported.

### Synthetic Touch Events

For `View` responder props (e.g., `onResponderMove`), the synthetic touch event passed to them are in form of [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type                                | Required | Platform |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| enum('none', 'polite', 'assertive') | No       | Android  |

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with `hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}`

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| Type                                                                             | Required |

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| string | No       |

---

### `onLayout`

Invoked on mount and on layout changes.

This event is fired immediately once the layout has been calculated, but the new layout may not yet be reflected on the screen at the time the event is received, especially if a layout animation is in progress.

| Type                                    | Required |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| ([LayoutEvent](layoutevent.md)) => void | No       |

---

### `onMoveShouldSetResponder`

Does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness? This is called for every touch move on the `View` when it is not the responder.

`View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponder: (event) => [true | false]`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a move, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

`View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture: (event) => [true | false]`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderGrant`

The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening.

`View.props.onResponderGrant: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderMove`

The user is moving their finger.

`View.props.onResponderMove: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderReject`

Another responder is already active and will not release it to that `View` asking to be the responder.

`View.props.onResponderReject: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderRelease`

Fired at the end of the touch.

`View.props.onResponderRelease: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderTerminate`

The responder has been taken from the `View`. Might be taken by other views after a call to `onResponderTerminationRequest`, or might be taken by the OS without asking (e.g., happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)

`View.props.onResponderTerminate: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onResponderTerminationRequest`

Some other `View` wants to become responder and is asking this `View` to release its responder. Returning `true` allows its release.

`View.props.onResponderTerminationRequest: (event) => {}`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`

If a parent `View` wants to prevent a child `View` from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have this handler which returns `true`.

`View.props.onStartShouldSetResponderCapture: (event) => [true | false]`, where `event` is a [PressEvent](pressevent.md).

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `pointerEvents`

Controls whether the `View` can be the target of touch events.

- `'auto'`: The View can be the target of touch events.
- `'none'`: The View is never the target of touch events.
- `'box-none'`: The View is never the target of touch events but its subviews can be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

```
.box-none {
     pointer-events: none;
}
.box-none * {
     pointer-events: auto;
}
```

- `'box-only'`: The view can be the target of touch events but its subviews cannot be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

```
.box-only {
     pointer-events: auto;
}
.box-only * {
     pointer-events: none;
}
```

> Since `pointerEvents` does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes, we opt to not include `pointerEvents` on `style`. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a `className` anyways. Using `style` or not is an implementation detail of the platform.

| Type                                         | Required |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('box-none', 'none', 'box-only', 'auto') | No       |

---

### `removeClippedSubviews`

This is a reserved performance property exposed by `RCTView` and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have `overflow: hidden`, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `style`

| Type                              | Required |
| --------------------------------- | -------- |
| [View Style](view-style-props.md) | No       |

---

### `testID`

Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.

> This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| string | No       |

---

### `collapsable`

Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization. Set this property to `false` to disable this optimization and ensure that this `View` exists in the native view hierarchy.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | Android  |

---

### `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`

Whether this `View` needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (`false`) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the `View` you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping `View`s, or text and a background).

Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`

Whether this `View` should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.

On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | Android  |

---

### `shouldRasterizeIOS`

Whether this `View` should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.

On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame.

Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---
