**package.json** is a JSON file that contains the metadata for a JavaScript project. This is a reference to Expo-specific properties that can be used in the **package.json** file.

## `install`

### `exclude`

The following commands perform a version check for the libraries installed in a project and give a warning when a library's version is different from the version recommended by Expo:

- `npx expo start` and `npx expo-doctor`
- `npx expo install` (when installing a new version of that library or using `--check` or `--fix` options)

By specifying the library under the `install.exclude` array in the **package.json** file, you can exclude it from the version checks:

```json package.json
{
  /* @hide Other package.json properties... */ /* @end */
  "expo": {
    "install": {
      "exclude": ["expo-updates", "expo-splash-screen"]
    }
  }
}
```

## `autolinking`

Allows configuring module resolution behavior by using `autolinking` property in **package.json**.

For complete reference, see [Autolinking configuration](/modules/autolinking/#configuration).

## `doctor`

Allows configuring the behavior of the [`npx expo-doctor`](/develop/tools/#expo-doctor) command.

### `reactNativeDirectoryCheck`

By default, Expo Doctor validates your project's packages against the [React Native directory](https://reactnative.directory/). This check throws a warning with a list of packages that are not included in the React Native Directory.

You can customize this check by adding the following configuration in your project's **package.json** file:

```json package.json
{
  "expo": {
    "doctor": {
      "reactNativeDirectoryCheck": {
        /* @info Use this option to disable/enable the check. */
        "enabled": true,
        /* @end */
        /* @info Use this option to exclude specific packages. */
        "exclude": ["/foo/", "bar"],
        /* @end */
        /* @info Use this option to disable/enable listing unknown packages. */
        "listUnknownPackages": true
        /* @end */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the check is enabled and unknown packages are listed.

### `appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck`

Expo Doctor checks if your project includes native project directories such as **android** or **ios**. If these directories exist but are not listed in your **.gitignore** or [**.easignore**](/build-reference/easignore) files, Expo Doctor verifies the presence of an app config file. If this file exists, it means your project is configured to use [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

When the **android** or **ios** folders are present, EAS Build does not sync app config properties to the native projects. Expo Doctor throws a warning if these conditions are true.

You can disable/enable this check by adding the following configuration to your project's **package.json** file:

```json package.json
{
  "expo": {
    "doctor": {
      "appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
