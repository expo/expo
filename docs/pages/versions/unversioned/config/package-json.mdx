**package.json** is a JSON file that contains the metadata for a JavaScript project. This is a reference to Expo-specific properties that can be used in the **package.json** file.

## `install`

### `exclude`

The following commands perform a version check for the libraries installed in a project and give a warning when a library's version is different from the version recommended by Expo:

- `npx expo start` and `npx expo-doctor`
- `npx expo install` (when installing a new version of that library or using `--check` or `--fix` options)

By specifying the library under the `install.exclude` array in the **package.json** file, you can exclude it from the version checks:

```json package.json
{
  /* @hide Other package.json properties... */ /* @end */
  "expo": {
    "install": {
      "exclude": ["expo-updates", "expo-splash-screen"]
    }
  }
}
```

## `autolinking`

Allows configuring module resolution behavior by using `autolinking` property in **package.json**.

For complete reference, see [Autolinking configuration](/modules/autolinking/#configuration).
