[Expo](http://expo.io) is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## Quick start

If you are already experienced with React and JavaScript tooling and want to dive right in and figure things out as you go, this is the quickest way to get started:

<TerminalBlock cmd={['# Install the command line tools', 'npm install --global expo-cli','', '# Create a new project', 'expo init my-project']} />
