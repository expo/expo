> **important** **This library is currently in alpha and will frequently experience breaking changes.** It is not available in the Expo Go app &mdash; use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to try it out.

The Jetpack Compose components in `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` allow you to build fully native Android interfaces using Jetpack Compose from React Native.
