import { APIInstallSection } from '~/components/plugins/InstallSection';

`@react-native-community/netinfo` allows you to get information about connection type and connection quality.

## Installation

<APIInstallSection href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo#getting-started" />

## API

To import this library, use:

```js
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';
```

If you want to grab information about the network connection just once, you can use:

```js
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log('Connection type', state.type);
  console.log('Is connected?', state.isConnected);
});
```

Or, if you'd rather subscribe to updates about the network state (which then allows you to run code/perform actions anytime the network state changes) use:

```js
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log('Connection type', state.type);
  console.log('Is connected?', state.isConnected);
});

// To unsubscribe to these update, just use:
unsubscribe();
```

## Accessing the SSID

To access the `ssid` property (available under `state.details.ssid`), there are a few additional configuration steps:

#### Android and iOS

- Request location permissions with [`Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()`](location.mdx#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) or [`Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`](location.mdx#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync).

#### iOS only

- Add the `com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info` entitlement to your **app.json** under `ios.entitlements`:

```json
  "ios": {
    "entitlements": {
      "com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info": true
    }
  }
```

- Check the **Access Wi-Fi Information** box in your app's App Identifier, [which can be found here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).
- Rebuild your app with [`eas build --platform ios`](/build/setup/#4-run-a-build) or [`npx expo run:ios`](/more/expo-cli/#compiling).

For more information on API and usage, see [`react-native-netinfo` documentation](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo#react-native-communitynetinfo).
