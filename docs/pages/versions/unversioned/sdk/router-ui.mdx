`expo-router` is a routing library for React Native and web apps. It enables navigation management using a file-based routing system and provides native navigation components and is built on top of [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). See the [Expo Router Reference](./expo-router) for more information.

`expo-router/ui` is a submodule that exports components and hooks required to build layouts more advance/customizable than the default [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) navigators provided by `expo-router`.
