`expo-dev-client` adds various useful development tools to your debug builds:

- A configurable launcher UI, so you can launch updates (such as from [PR previews](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows#pr-previews)) and switch between development servers without needing to recompile the native app
- Improved debugging tools (such as support for [inspecting network requests](/debugging/tools/#inspecting-network-requests))
- [A powerful and extensible developer menu UI](/debugging/tools#developer-menu)

Expo documentation refers to debug builds that include `expo-dev-client` as [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

## Installation

<APIInstallSection />

## Configuration in app.json/app.config.js

You can configure development client launcher using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

<ConfigPluginExample>

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-dev-launcher",
        {
          "launchMode": "most-recent"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

</ConfigPluginExample>

<ConfigPluginProperties
  properties={[
    {
      name: 'launchMode',
      description: [
        'Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen.',
        '* `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.',
        '* `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.',
      ].join('\n'),
      default: '"most-recent"',
    },
    {
      name: 'addGeneratedScheme',
      description: [
        'By default, `expo-dev-client` will register a custom URL scheme to open a project. Set this property to `false` to disable this scheme.',
      ].join('\n'),
      default: 'true',
    },
  ]}
/>

## API

```js
import * as DevClient from 'expo-dev-client';
