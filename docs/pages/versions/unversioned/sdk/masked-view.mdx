`@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` provides a masked view that only displays the pixels that overlap with the view rendered in its mask element.

> **warning** You can only have one of either `@react-native-community/masked-view` (deprecated) or `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` installed in your project at any given time. React Navigation v6 and above requires `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view`, so you should use that package instead if you are using the latest version of React Navigation.

> **warning** Android support for this library is experimental and you may encounter inconsistencies in behavior across platforms. Report issues you encounter to [`react-native-masked-view` GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view).
