The standard URL API is available on all Expo-supported platforms.

## Installation

This API is part of the `expo` package. On native platforms, built-in `URL` and `URLSearchParams` implementations replace the shims in `react-native`. Refer to the [browser and server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/url) for web and Node.js.

## Usage

```js
const url = new URL('https://expo.dev');

const params = new URLSearchParams();
```

## Conformance

Expo's built-in URL support attempts to be fully [spec compliant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL).

The only missing exception is that native platforms do not currently support [non-ASCII characters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) in the hostname.

Consider the following example:

```js
console.log(new URL('http://🥓').toString())
```

This outputs the following:
- Web, Node.js: `http://xn--pr9h/`
- iOS, Android: `http://🥓/`
