> **info** This library is listed in the Expo SDK reference because it is included in [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go/). You may use any library of your choice with [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

> **info** In SDK 49 and higher, this library will no longer be available in [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go/). You can still use it with [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).
