title: Camera
---

A React component that renders a preview for the device's either front or back camera. Camera's parameters like zoom, auto focus, white balance and flash mode are adjustable. With use of `Camera` one can also take photos and record videos that are saved to the app's cache. Morever, the component is also capable of detecting faces and bar codes appearing on the preview.

> **Note**: Only one active Camera preview is supported currently. When using navigation, the best practice is to unmount previously rendered `Camera` component so next screens can use camera without issues.
> <br/>

> **Note**: Android devices can use one of two available Camera apis underneath. This was previously chosen automatically, based on the device's Android system version and camera hardware capabilities. As we experienced some issues with Android's Camera2 API, we decided to choose the older API as a default. However, using the newer one is still possible through setting `useCamera2Api` prop to true. The change we made should be barely visible - the only thing that is not supported using the old Android's API is setting focus depth.

> **Note**: The Camera API will not work on simulators or emulators.

## Installation

For [managed](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) apps, you'll need to run `expo install expo-camera`. To use it in a [bare](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow) React Native app, follow its [installation instructions](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-camera).

## Configuration

In managed apps, `Camera` requires `Permissions.CAMERA`. Video recording requires `Permissions.AUDIO_RECORDING`.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

export default class CameraExample extends React.Component {
  state = {
    hasCameraPermission: null,
    type: Camera.Constants.Type.back,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
    this.setState({ hasCameraPermission: status === 'granted' });
  }

  render() {
    const { hasCameraPermission } = this.state;
    if (hasCameraPermission === null) {
      return <View />;
    } else if (hasCameraPermission === false) {
      return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
    } else {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={this.state.type}>
            <View
              style={{
                flex: 1,
                backgroundColor: 'transparent',
                flexDirection: 'row',
              }}>
              <TouchableOpacity
                style={{
                  flex: 0.1,
                  alignSelf: 'flex-end',
                  alignItems: 'center',
                }}
                onPress={() => {
                  this.setState({
                    type:
                      this.state.type === Camera.Constants.Type.back
                        ? Camera.Constants.Type.front
                        : Camera.Constants.Type.back,
                  });
                }}>
                <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, marginBottom: 10, color: 'white' }}> Flip </Text>
              </TouchableOpacity>
            </View>
          </Camera>
        </View>
      );
    }
  }
}
```

## API

```js
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
```

### props

- **type**

Camera facing. Use one of `Camera.Constants.Type`. When `Type.front`, use the front-facing camera. When `Type.back`, use the back-facing camera. Default: `Type.back`.

- **flashMode**

Camera flash mode. Use one of `Camera.Constants.FlashMode`. When `on`, the flash on your device will turn on when taking a picture, when `off`, it won't. Setting to `auto` will fire flash if required, `torch` turns on flash during the preview. Default: `off`.

- **autoFocus**

State of camera auto focus. Use one of `Camera.Constants.AutoFocus`. When `on`, auto focus will be enabled, when `off`, it wont't and focus will lock as it was in the moment of change but it can be adjusted on some devices via `focusDepth` prop.

- **zoom** (_float_)

A value between 0 and 1 being a percentage of device's max zoom. 0 - not zoomed, 1 - maximum zoom. Default: 0.

- **whiteBalance**

Camera white balance. Use one of `Camera.Constants.WhiteBalance`: `auto`, `sunny`, `cloudy`, `shadow`, `fluorescent`, `incandescent`. If a device does not support any of these values previous one is used.

- **focusDepth** (_float_)

Distance to plane of sharpest focus. A value between 0 and 1: 0 - infinity focus, 1 - focus as close as possible. Default: 0. For Android this is available only for some devices and when `useCamera2Api` is set to true.

- **ratio** (_string_)

Android only. A string representing aspect ratio of the preview, eg. `4:3`, `16:9`, `1:1`. To check if a ratio is supported by the device use `getSupportedRatiosAsync`. Default: `4:3`.

- **pictureSize** (_string_)

A string representing the size of pictures `takePictureAsync` will take. Available sizes can be fetched with `getAvailablePictureSizesAsync`.

- **onCameraReady** (_function_)

Callback invoked when camera preview has been set.

- **onFacesDetected** (_function_)

Callback invoked with results of face detection on the preview. See [FaceDetector documentation](../facedetector/#event-shape) for details.

- **faceDetectorSettings** (_Object_)

A settings object passed directly to an underlying module providing face detection features. See [FaceDetector documentation](../facedetector/#settings) for details.

- **onMountError** (_function_)

Callback invoked when camera preview could not been started. It is provided with an error object that contains a `message`.

- **onBarCodeRead (_function_)**

**Deprecated**. Use **onBarCodeScanned** instead.

- **onBarCodeScanned (_function_)**

Callback that is invoked when a bar code has been successfully scanned. The callback is provided with an object of the shape `{ type: BarCodeScanner.Constants.BarCodeType, data: string }`, where the type refers to the bar code type that was scanned and the data is the information encoded in the bar code (in this case of QR codes, this is often a URL). See [`BarCodeScanner.Constants.BarCodeType`](../bar-code-scanner/#supported-formats) for supported values.

- **barCodeTypes (_Array\<string\>_)**

**Deprecated**. Use **barCodeScannerSettings** instead.

- **barCodeScannerSettings (_object_)**

Settings exposed by [`BarCodeScanner`](../bar-code-scanner/) module. Supported settings: [**barCodeTypes**].

```javascript
<Camera
  barCodeScannerSettings={{
    barCodeTypes: [BarCodeScanner.Constants.BarCodeType.qr],
  }}
/>
```

- **useCamera2Api** (_boolean_)

**Android only**. Whether to use Android's Camera2 API. See `Note` at the top of this page.

- **videoStabilizationMode** (_Camera.Constants.VideoStabilization_)

**iOS only**. The video stabilization mode used for a video recording. Use one of `Camera.Constants.VideoStabilization.{off, standard, cinematic, auto}`.

You can read more about each stabilization type [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideostabilizationmode).

## Methods

To use methods that Camera exposes one has to create a components `ref` and invoke them using it.

```javascript
// ...
<Camera
  ref={ref => {
    this.camera = ref;
  }}
/>;
// ...
snap = async () => {
  if (this.camera) {
    let photo = await this.camera.takePictureAsync();
  }
};
```

### `takePictureAsync`

Takes a picture and saves it to app's cache directory. Photos are rotated to match device's orientation (if **options.skipProcessing** flag is not enabled) and scaled to match the preview. Anyway on Android it is essential to set `ratio` prop to get a picture with correct dimensions.

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** --

  A map of options:

  - **quality (_number_)** -- Specify the quality of compression, from 0 to 1. 0 means compress for small size, 1 means compress for maximum quality.
  - **base64 (_boolean_)** -- Whether to also include the image data in Base64 format.
  - **exif (_boolean_)** -- Whether to also include the EXIF data for the image.
  - **onPictureSaved (_function_)** -- A callback invoked when picture is saved. If set, the promise of this method will resolve immediately with no data after picture is captured. The data that it should contain will be passed to this callback. If displaying or processing a captured photo right after taking it is not your case, this callback lets you skip waiting for it to be saved.
  - **skipProcessing (_boolean_)** - Android only. If set to `true`, camera skips orientation adjustment and returns an image straight from the device's camera. If enabled, `quality` option is discarded (processing pipeline is skipped as a whole). Although enabling this option reduces image delivery time significantly, it may cause the image to appear in a wrong orientation in the `Image` component (at the time of writing, it does not respect EXIF orientation of the images).
    > **Note**: Enabling **skipProcessing** would cause orientation uncertainty. `Image` component does not respect EXIF stored orientation information, that means obtained image would be displayed wrongly (rotated by 90°, 180° or 270°). Different devices provide different orientations. For example some Sony Xperia or Samsung devices don't provide correctly oriented images by default. To always obtain correctly oriented image disable **skipProcessing** option.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object: `{ uri, width, height, exif, base64 }` where `uri` is a URI to the local image file (useable as the source for an `Image` element) and `width, height` specify the dimensions of the image. `base64` is included if the `base64` option was truthy, and is a string containing the JPEG data of the image in Base64--prepend that with `'data:image/jpg;base64,'` to get a data URI, which you can use as the source for an `Image` element for example. `exif` is included if the `exif` option was truthy, and is an object containing EXIF data for the image--the names of its properties are EXIF tags and their values are the values for those tags.

The local image URI is temporary. Use [`FileSystem.copyAsync`](../filesystem/#expofilesystemcopyasyncoptions) to make a permanent copy of the image.

### `recordAsync`

Starts recording a video that will be saved to cache directory. Videos are rotated to match device's orientation. Flipping camera during a recording results in stopping it.

#### Arguments

- **options (_object_)** --

  A map of options:

  - **quality (_VideoQuality_)** -- Specify the quality of recorded video. Usage: `Camera.Constants.VideoQuality['<value>']`, possible values: for 16:9 resolution `2160p`, `1080p`, `720p`, `480p` : `Android only` and for 4:3 `4:3` (the size is 640x480). If the chosen quality is not available for a device, the highest available is chosen.
  - **maxDuration (_number_)** -- Maximum video duration in seconds.
  - **maxFileSize (_number_)** -- Maximum video file size in bytes.
  - **mute (_boolean_)** -- If present, video will be recorded with no sound.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing video file `uri` property. The Promise is returned if `stopRecording` was invoked, one of `maxDuration` and `maxFileSize` is reached or camera preview is stopped.

### `stopRecording`

Stops recording if any is in progress.

### `getSupportedRatiosAsync`

Android only. Get aspect ratios that are supported by the device and can be passed via `ratio` prop.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of strings representing ratios, eg. `['4:3', '1:1']`.

### `getAvailablePictureSizesAsync`

Get picture sizes that are supported by the device for given `ratio`.

#### Arguments

- **ratio (_string_)** -- A string representing aspect ratio of sizes to be returned.

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of strings representing picture sizes that can be passed to `pictureSize` prop. The list varies across Android devices but is the same for every iOS.

### `pausePreview`

Pauses the camera preview. It is not recommended to use `takePictureAsync` when preview is paused.

### `resumePreview`

Resumes the camera preview.
