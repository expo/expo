`react-native-gesture-handler` is a library for handling complex gestures. From it's README:

> This library provides an API that exposes mobile platform-specific native capabilities of touch and gesture handling and recognition. It allows for defining complex gesture handling and recognition logic that runs 100% in the native thread and is therefore deterministic.
