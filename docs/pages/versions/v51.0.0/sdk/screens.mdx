`react-native-screens` provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain `<View>` components To better take advantage of operating system behavior and optimizations around screens. This capability is used by library authors and is unlikely to be used directly by most app developers. It also provides the native components needed for React Navigation's [`createNativeStackNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator).

> **Note**: See [`react-native-screens` issue tracker](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues) if you encounter any problems.
