It's like a fancy radio button, or in Apple's words: "A horizontal control that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete button" ([source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol)]). This component renders to a [`UISegmentedControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol) on iOS, and to faithful recreations of that control on Android and web (because no equivalent exists on those platforms' standard libraries).
