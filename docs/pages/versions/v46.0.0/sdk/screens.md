**`react-native-screens`** provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain `<View>` components in order to better take advantage of operating system behavior and optimizations around screens. This capability is used by library authors and unlikely to be used directly by most app developers. It also provides the native components needed for React Navigation's [createNativeStackNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator).

> Note: Please refer to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues) if you encounter any problems.
