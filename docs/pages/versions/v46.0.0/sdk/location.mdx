`expo-location` allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

## Installation

## Configuration

### Android permissions

When you install the `expo-location` module, it automatically adds the following permissions:

- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: for approximate device location
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: for precise device location
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: to subscribe to location updates while the app is in use

To use background location features, you must add the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` in **app.json** and [submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150?hl=en).

<AndroidPermissions
  permissions={[
    'ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION',
    'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION',
    'FOREGROUND_SERVICE',
    'ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION',
  ]}
/>

#### Excluding a permission

> **Note**: Excluding a **required permission** from a module in your app can break the functionality corresponding to that permission. Always make sure to include all permissions a module is dependent on.

When your Expo project doesn't benefit from having particular permission included, you can omit it. For example, if your application doesn't need access to the precise location, you can exclude the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.

Another example can be stated using [available location accuracies](#accuracy). Android defines the approximate location accuracy estimation within about 3 square kilometers, and the precise location accuracy estimation within about 50 meters. For example, if the location accuracy value is [Low](#low), you can exclude `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. To learn more about levels of location accuracies, see [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions#accuracy).

To learn more on how to exclude a permission, see [Excluding Android permissions](/guides/permissions/#excluding-android-permissions).

### Background Location methods

To use Background Location methods, the following requirements apply:

- Location permissions must be granted. On iOS it must be granted with `Always` option.
- **(_iOS only_)** `"location"` background mode must be specified in **Info.plist** file. See [background tasks configuration guide](task-manager.mdx#configuration).
- Background location task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [TaskManager.defineTask](task-manager.mdx#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).

### Geofencing methods

To use Geofencing methods, the following requirements apply:

- Location permissions must be granted. On iOS it must be granted with `Always` option.
- The Geofencing task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [TaskManager.defineTask](task-manager.mdx#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).
- On iOS, there is a [limit of 20](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) `regions` that can be simultaneously monitored.

## Usage

If you're using the iOS or Android Emulators, ensure that [Location is enabled](#enabling-emulator-location).

<SnackInline label='Location' dependencies={['expo-location', 'expo-constants']}>

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Platform, Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
/* @hide */
import Device from 'expo-device';
/* @end */
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

export default function App() {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);
  const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      /* @hide */
      if (Platform.OS === 'android' && !Device.isDevice) {
        setErrorMsg(
          'Oops, this will not work on Snack in an Android Emulator. Try it on your device!'
        );
        return;
      }
      /* @end */
      let { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        setErrorMsg('Permission to access location was denied');
        return;
      }

      let location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
      setLocation(location);
    })();
  }, []);

  let text = 'Waiting..';
  if (errorMsg) {
    text = errorMsg;
  } else if (location) {
    text = JSON.stringify(location);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>{text}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

/* @hide const styles = StyleSheet.create({ ... }); */
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  paragraph: {
    fontSize: 18,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});
/* @end */
```

</SnackInline>

## Enabling Emulator Location

### Android Emulator

Open Android Studio, and launch the Android Emulator. Inside it, go to **Settings** > **Location** and enable **Use location**.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Location settings in Android Emulator for versions 12 and higher"
  src="/static/images/sdk/location/enable-android-emulator-location.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 360 }}
/>

If you don't receive the locations in the emulator, you may have to turn off "Improve Location Accuracy" in Settings - Location in the emulator. This will turn off Wi-Fi location and only use GPS. Then you can manipulate the location with GPS data through the emulator.

### iOS Simulator

With Simulator open, go to **Features** > **Location** and choose any option besides **None**.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Location settings in iOS simulator."
  src="/static/images/sdk/location/ios-simulator-location.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 480 }}
/>

## API

```js
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
```

<APISection packageName="expo-location" apiName="Location" />
