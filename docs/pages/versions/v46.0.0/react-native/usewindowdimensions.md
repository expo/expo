```js
import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
```

`useWindowDimensions` automatically updates `width` and `height` values when screen size changes. You can get your application window's width and height like so:

```js
const windowWidth = useWindowDimensions().width;
const windowHeight = useWindowDimensions().height;
```

## Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Text, useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const window = useWindowDimensions();
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>{`Window Dimensions: height - ${window.height}, width - ${window.width}`}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

- The [useDimensions](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-hooks#usedimensions) hook from the community [React Native hooks](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-hooks) library aims to make handling screen/window size changes easier to work with.
- [React Native Responsive Dimensions](https://github.com/DaniAkash/react-native-responsive-dimensions) also comes with responsive hooks.
