**`expo-store-review`** provides access to the `SKStoreReviewController` API in iOS 10.3+ devices, allowing you to ask the user to rate your app without ever having to leave the app itself.

> If this is used in Android the device will attempt to link to the Play Store using native `Linking` and the `android.playStoreUrl` from **app.config.js** or **app.json** instead.

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-store-review" />

## API

```js
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review';
```

### `StoreReview.requestReview()`

In the ideal circumstance this will open a native modal and allow the user to select a star rating that will then be applied to the App Store without leaving the app.
If the users device is running a version of iOS lower than 10.3, or the user is on an Android device, this will attempt to get the store URL and link the user to it.

#### Error Codes

- [`ERR_STORE_REVIEW_UNSUPPORTED`](#err_store_review_unsupported)

#### Example

```js
StoreReview.requestReview();
```

### `StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()`

Determines if the platform has the capabilities to use `StoreReview.requestReview()`. On iOS, this will return `true` if the device is running iOS 10.3+. On Android, this will return `true`. On Web, this will return `false`.

#### Example

```js
StoreReview.isAvailableAsync();
```

### `StoreReview.storeUrl()`

This uses the `Constants` API to get the `Constants.manifest.ios.appStoreUrl` on iOS, or the `Constants.manifest.android.playStoreUrl` on Android.

In the bare workflow, this will return `null`.

#### Example

```js
const url = StoreReview.storeUrl();
```

### `StoreReview.hasAction()`

This returns a promise that resolves to a boolean that let's you know if the module can perform any action. This is used for cases where the **app.json** doesn't have the proper fields, and `StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()` returns false.

#### Example

```js
if (await StoreReview.hasAction()) {
}
```

## Error Codes

### `E_STORE_REVIEW_UNSUPPORTED`

Requesting an App Store review is not supported on this device. The device must be iOS 10.3 or greater. Android and web are not supported. Be sure to check for support with `isAvailableAsync()` to avoid this error.

## Usage

It is important that you follow the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/system-capabilities/ratings-and-reviews/) when using this API.

**Specifically:**

- Don't call `StoreReview.requestReview()` from a button - instead try calling it after the user has finished some signature interaction in the app.
- Don't spam the user
- Don't request a review when the user is doing something time sensitive like navigating.

### Write Reviews

#### iOS

You can redirect someone to the "Write a Review" screen for an app in the iOS App Store by using the query parameter `action=write-review`. For example:

```ts
const itunesItemId = 982107779;
// Open the iOS App Store in the browser -> redirects to App Store on iOS
Linking.openURL(`https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`);
// Open the iOS App Store directly
Linking.openURL(
  `itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/viewContentsUserReviews/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`
);
```

#### Android

There is no equivalent redirect on Android, you can still open the Play Store to the reviews sections using the query parameter `showAllReviews=true` like this:

```ts
const androidPackageName = 'host.exp.exponent';
// Open the Android Play Store in the browser -> redirects to Play Store on Android
Linking.openURL(
  `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`
);
// Open the Android Play Store directly
Linking.openURL(`market://details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`);
```
