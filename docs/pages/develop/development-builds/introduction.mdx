A **development build** is a debug build of your app that contains the [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/) package. By using development builds instead of [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go/), you gain full control over the native runtime, so you can [install any native libraries](/workflow/using-libraries/#determining-third-party-library-compatibility), [modify any project configuration](/config-plugins/introduction/), or [write your own native code](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/get-started/). With Expo development builds, you are building a native app, while with Expo Go you are running your app in a sandboxed native environment.

The [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/) package replaces the default in-app development tools UI that React Native provides with [a more powerful and extensible UI](/debugging/tools/#developer-menu), adds [support for network debugging](/debugging/tools/#inspecting-network-requests), adds support for [launching updates](/eas-update/expo-dev-client/) (such as from [PR previews](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows/#pr-previews)), and adds a launcher UI.

The launcher UI makes it possible to switch between development servers without needing to rebuild the app binary. This works great alongside [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) because you can generate a single development build whenever you modify the native code in your app, and then you can iterate on the JavaScript code without needing to rebuild the native code until the next time that you need to modify it. It also works great without CNG â€” this approach is very well suited to teams have specialized native engineers that work on the native runtime and application developers that specialize in React to [achieve web-like iteration speeds](https://blog.expo.dev/javascript-driven-development-with-custom-runtimes-eda87d574c9d) with native apps, without compromise.

## Frequently asked questions

<Collapsible summary="What is a native runtime?">

**A native runtime** refers to the runtime environment that your JavaScript application code is executed in. If your development build is compiled with `expo-camera` installed, the native runtime will include the appropriate code so that you can access that functionality from JavaScript. If the build was not compiled with `expo-camera`, then you cannot access that code from your JavaScript app. Different versions of your app runtime are managed with a ["runtime version"](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/runtime-versions/) configuration field.

<Collapsible summary="How are development builds different from Expo Go?">

When you start a new project with Expo, the fastest and easiest way to get to "Hello, world!" is with [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go/) on your device because you don't need to compile any native code or install any native tooling.

Beyond "Hello, world!" and protoypes, you'll quickly encounter limitations and need to build a development build of your app. For example, the Expo Go sandbox environment is limited to only the native packages included in the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/), while you can include any library

You can think of a development build as your fully customizable version of Expo Go, tailored specifically for your project.

<Collapsible summary="What other types of builds are there?">

As a production build is for the general public, and a preview build lets your team test your next release, a development build lets developers iterate as quickly as possible.
