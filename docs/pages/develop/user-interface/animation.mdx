Animations are a great way to enhance and provide a better user experience. In your Expo projects, you can use the [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/animations) from React Native. However, if you want to use more advanced animations with better performance, you can use the [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) library. It provides an API that simplifies the process of creating smooth, powerful, and maintainable animations.

## Installation

To install `react-native-reanimated`, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install react-native-reanimated']} />

<Tabs>

<Tab label="SDK 50 and higher">

No additional configuration is required for SDK 50 and above. [Reanimated Babel plugin](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/glossary#reanimated-babel-plugin) is automatically configured in `babel-expo-preset` when you install the library.

</Tab>

<Tab label="SDK 49 and lower">

After the installation completes, add the Babel plugin to **babel.config.js**:

```js babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    /* @info Add the Reanimated Babel Plugin as the last item in the plugins array.*/
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
    /* @end */
  };
};
```

After you add the Babel plugin, restart your development server and clear the bundler cache using the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start --clear']} />

> If you load other Babel plugins, the Reanimated plugin has to be the last item in the plugins array.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Web support

<Tabs>

<Tab label="SDK 50 and higher">

No additional configuration is required for SDK 50 and above when using `react-native-reanimated`.

</Tab>

<Tab label="SDK 49">

No additional configuration is required for web. Make sure that `react-native-reanimated/plugin` is added to **babel.config.js** as mentioned in [SDK 49 and below installation step](/#installation).

## Minimal example

The following example shows how to use the `react-native-reanimated` library to create a simple animation. For more information on the API and its usage, see [`react-native-reanimated` documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/your-first-animation).

<SnackInline label="Using react-native-reanimated" dependencies={['react-native-reanimated']}>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx
import Animated, {
  useSharedValue,
  withTiming,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  Easing,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function AnimatedStyleUpdateExample() {
  const randomWidth = useSharedValue(10);

  const config = {
    duration: 500,
    easing: Easing.bezier(0.5, 0.01, 0, 1),
  };

  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      width: withTiming(randomWidth.value, config),
    };
  });

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, style]} />
      <Button
        title="toggle"
        onPress={() => {
          randomWidth.value = Math.random() * 350;
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 100,
    height: 80,
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    margin: 30,
  },
});
```

</SnackInline>

## Other animation libraries

Other animation packages are available, such as [Moti](https://moti.fyi/), that you can use in your Expo project and work on Android, iOS, and web.
