A splash screen and an app icon are fundamental elements of a mobile app. They play an important role in the user experience and branding of the app. This guide provides steps on how to create and add them to your app.

## Splash screen

A splash screen, also known as a launch screen, is the first screen a user sees when they open your app. It stays visible while the app is loading. You can also control the behavior of when a splash screen disappears by using the native [SplashScreen API](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen).

The [`expo-splash-screen`](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen) has a built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) that lets you configure properties such as the splash icon and background color.

> **Warning** Do not use Expo Go or a development build to test your splash screen. **Expo Go** renders your app icon while the splash screen is visible, which can interfere with testing. **Development builds** include `expo-dev-client`, which has its own splash screen and may cause conflicts. Instead, use a [preview build](/build/eas-json/#preview-builds) or a [production build](/build/eas-json/#production-builds).

<Step label="1">

### Create a splash screen icon

To create a splash screen icon, you can use this [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1466490409418563617). It provides a bare minimum design for an icon and splash images for Android and iOS.

**Recommended:**

- Use a 1024x1024 image.
- Use a **.png** file.
- Use a transparent background.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

### Export the splash icon as a .png

After creating a splash screen icon, export it as a **.png** and save it in the **assets/images** directory. By default, Expo uses **splash-icon.png** as the file name. If you decide to change the name of your splash screen file, make sure to use that in the next step.

> **Note:** **Currently, only .png images are supported** to use as a splash screen icon in an Expo project. If you use another image format, making a production build of your app will fail.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

### Configure the splash screen icon

Open the app config file, and under plugins, set the following properties:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-splash-screen",
        {
          /* @info The background color of the splash screen. */
          "backgroundColor": "#232323",
          /* @end */
          /* @info The path to the splash screen icon. */
          "image": "./assets/images/splash-icon.png",
          /* @end */
          /* @info The path to the splash screen icon for dark mode (optional). */
          "dark": {
            "image": "./assets/images/splash-icon-dark.png",
            /* @end */
            /* @info The background color of the splash screen for dark mode. */
            "backgroundColor": "#000000"
            /* @end */
          },
          /* @info The width of the splash screen icon. */
          "imageWidth": 200
          /* @end */
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

To test your new splash screen, build your app for [internal distribution](/tutorial/eas/internal-distribution-builds) or for production, see guides on [Android](/tutorial/eas/android-production-build/) and [iOS](/tutorial/eas/ios-production-build/).

[`expo-splash-screen`](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen) also supports `android` and `ios` properties for configuring the splash screen for a specific platform. See the following example:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-splash-screen",
        {
          "ios": {
            "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
            "image": "./assets/images/splash-icon.png",
            "resizeMode": "cover",
          },
          "android": {
            "backgroundColor": "#0c7cff",
            "image": "./assets/images/splash-android-icon.png",
            "imageWidth": 150,
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

<Collapsible summary="Not using prebuild?">

If your app does not use [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) (formerly the _managed workflow_) to generate the native **android** and **iOS** directories, then changes in the app config will have no effect. For more information, see [how you can customize the configuration manually](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-splash-screen#-installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

## App icon

An app's icon is what your app users see on their device's home screen and app stores. Android and iOS have different and strict requirements.

<Step label="1">

### Create an app icon

To create an app icon, you can use this [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1466490409418563617). It provides a bare minimum design for an icon and splash images for Android and iOS.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

### Export the icon image as a .png

After creating an app icon, export it as **.png** and save it in the **assets/images** directory. By default, Expo uses **icon.png** as the file name. If you decide to use a different file name, make sure to use that in the next step.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

### Add the icon in app config

Open the app config and add the local path as the value of [`icon`](/versions/latest/config/app/#icon) property to point it to your new app icon:

```json app.json
{
  "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png"
}
```

<Collapsible summary="Custom configuration tips for Android and iOS">

#### Android

Further customization of the Android icon is possible using the [`android.adaptiveIcon`](/versions/latest/config/app/#adaptiveicon) property, which will override both of the previously mentioned settings.

The Android Adaptive Icon is formed from two separate layers &mdash; a foreground image and a background color or image. This allows the OS to mask the icon into different shapes and also supports visual effects. For Android 13 and later, the OS supports a themed app icon that uses a wallpaper and theme to determine the color set by the device's theme.

The design you provide should follow the [Android Adaptive Icon Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/icon_design_adaptive) for launcher icons. You should also:

- Use **.png** files.
- Use the `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage` property to specify the path to your foreground image.
- Use the `android.adaptiveIcon.monochromeImage` property to specify the path to your monochrome image.
- The default background color is white; to specify a different background color, use the `android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor` property. You can instead specify a background image using the `android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundImage` property. Make sure that it has the same dimensions as your foreground image.

You may also want to provide a separate icon for older Android devices that do not support Adaptive Icons. You can do so with the `android.icon` property. This single icon would be a combination of your foreground and background layers.

> See [Apple best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/#Best-practices) to ensure your icon looks professional, such as testing your icon on different wallpapers and avoiding text beside your product's wordmark. Provide an icon that's at least 512x512 pixels.

#### iOS

For iOS, your app's icon should follow the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/). You should also:

- Use a **.png** file.
- 1024x1024 is a good size. If you have an Expo project created using `npx create-expo-app`, [EAS Build](/build/setup/) will generate the other sizes for you. In case of a bare React Native project, generate the icons on your own. The largest size EAS Build generates is 1024x1024.
- The icon must be exactly square. For example, a 1023x1024 icon is not valid.
- Make sure the icon fills the whole square, with no rounded corners or other transparent pixels. The operating system will mask your icon when appropriate.
- Use `ios.icon` to specify different icons for various system appearances (for example, dark and tinted) can be provided. If specified, this overrides the top-level icon key in the app config file. See the example below:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "icon": {
        "dark": "./assets/images/ios-dark.png",
        "light": "./assets/images/ios-light.png",
        "tinted": "./assets/images/ios-tinted.png"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
