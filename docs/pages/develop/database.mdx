Most apps need to persist data beyond the lifetime of a single session. You can use a cloud-hosted database to store your app's data and sync it across devices and users.

## Convex

[Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) is a TypeScript-based database that requires no cluster management, SQL, or ORMs. Convex provides real-time updates over a WebSocket, making it perfect for reactive apps.
