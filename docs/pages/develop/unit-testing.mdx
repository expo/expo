[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is the most widely used JavaScript unit testing framework. In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Jest in your project, write a unit test, write a snapshot test, and best practices for structuring your tests when using Jest with React Native.

You'll also use the `jest-expo` package, which is a Jest preset and mocks the native part of the Expo SDK and handles most of the configuration.

## Installation

To install `jest-expo` in your project, run the following command:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# For all other package managers',
    '$ npx expo install -- --save-dev jest-expo jest',
    '',
    '# For yarn',
    '$ yarn add -D jest-expo jest',
  ]}
/>

> **info** If you are using TypeScript, then also install `@types/jest` as a dev dependency.

Then, update **package.json** to add a script for running tests and add the preset for using the base configuration from `jest-expo`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
"scripts": {
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  "test": "jest"
},
/* @hide ... */ /* @end */
"jest": {
  "preset": "jest-expo"
}
```

## Configuration

A starting configuration you can use is to make sure any modules you are using within the **node_modules** directory are transpiled when running Jest. This can be done by including the [`transformIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring) property that takes a regex pattern as its value:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="npm/Yarn">

```json package.json
"jest": {
  "preset": "jest-expo",
  "transformIgnorePatterns": [
    "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-svg)"
  ]
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="pnpm">

```json package.json
"jest": {
  "preset": "jest-expo",
  "transformIgnorePatterns": [
    "node_modules/(?!(?:.pnpm/)?((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-svg))"
  ]
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Jest has various configuration options. The above configuration covers the majority of your needs. However, you can always add to this pattern list. For more details, see [Configuring Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration).

## Unit test

A unit test is used to check the smallest unit of code, usually a function.

To write your first unit test, start by writing a simple test for **App.js**. Create a test file for it and call it **App.test.js**. Jest identifies a file with the **.test.js** extension as a test and includes it in the tests queue. There are also other ways to [structure a test](#structure-your-tests).

The test will expect the state of the `<App />` component to have one child element:

```jsx App.test.js
import React from 'react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

import App from './App';

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('has 1 child', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();
    expect(tree.children.length).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

> **info** If you are using TypeScript, use **.ts** or **.tsx** file extension.

To run the test:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run test']} />

If everything goes well, you should see the one test passed. For more information, see [expect and conditional matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect).

## Structure your tests

Right now, you have a single test file in the project directory. Adding more test files can make it hard to organize your project directory. The easiest way to avoid this is to create a **\_\_tests\_\_** directory and put all your tests inside it.

An example structure is shown below:

<FileTree
  files={[
    '__tests__/components/button.test.js',
    '__tests__/navigation/mainstack.test.js',
    '__tests__/screens/home.test.js',
    'src/components/button.js',
    'src/navigation/mainstack.js',
    'src/screens/home.js',
  ]}
/>

However, this approach causes a lot of long import paths, such as `../../src/components/button`.

Alternatively, you can have multiple **\_\_tests\_\_** sub-directories for different areas of your project. For example, create a separate test directory for **components**, **navigation**, and so on:

<FileTree files={['src/components/button.js', 'src/components/__tests__/button.test.js']} />

Now, if you move **\_\_tests\_\_** within the **components** directory, the import path of `<Button>` in the the **button.test.js** will be `../button`.

Another option for test/file structure:

<FileTree
  files={[
    'src/components/button.js',
    'src/components/button.style.js',
    'src/components/button.test.js',
  ]}
/>

It's all about preferences and up to you to decide how you want to organize your project directory.

## Snapshot test

A snapshot test is used to make sure that UI stays consistent, especially when a project is working with global styles that are potentially shared across components. For more information, see [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing).

To add a snapshot test for `<App />`, add the following code snippet in the `describe()` in **App.test.js**:

```jsx App.test.js
it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Run `npm run test` command, and if everything goes well, you should see a snapshot created and two tests passed.

## Code coverage reports

Code coverage reports can help you understand how much of your code is tested.

If you'd like to see code coverage report in your project using the HTML format, add the following to the **package.json**:

```json package.json
"jest": {
  ...
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "collectCoverageFrom": [
    "**/*.{js,jsx}",
    "!**/coverage/**",
    "!**/node_modules/**",
    "!**/babel.config.js",
    "!**/jest.setup.js"
  ]
}
```

Adding the above snippet allows Jest to collect coverage of all **.js** and **.jsx** files that are not inside the **coverage** or **node_modules** directories. It also excludes the **babel.config.js** and **jest.setup.js** files. You can add or remove more to this list to match your needs.

Run `npm run test`. You should see a **coverage** directory created in your project. Find the **index.html** file within this directory and double-click to open it up in a browser to see the coverage report.

> Usually, we don't recommend uploading **index.html** file to git. To prevent it from being tracked, you can add `coverage/**/*` in the **.gitignore** file.

## Optional: Jest flows

You can also use different flows to run your tests. Below are a few example scripts that you can try:

```json package.json
"scripts": {
  ...
  // active development of tests, watch files for changes and re-runs all tests
  "test": "jest --watch --coverage=false --changedSince=origin/main",

  // debug, console.logs and only re-runs the file that was changed
  "testDebug": "jest -o --watch --coverage=false",

  // displays code coverage in cli and updates the code coverage html
  "testFinal": "jest",

  // when a screen/component is updated, the test snapshots will throw an error, this updates them
  "updateSnapshots": "jest -u --coverage=false"
}
```

For more information, see [CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) in Jest documentation.
