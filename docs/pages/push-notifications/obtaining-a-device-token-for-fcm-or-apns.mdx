Before communicating directly with FCM and APNs, there is one client-side change you'll need to make in your app. When using Expo's notification service, you collect the `ExponentPushToken` with [`getExpoPushTokenAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getexpopushtokenasyncoptions-expotokenoptions-expopushtoken). Now that you're not using Expo's notification service, you'll need to collect the native device token instead with [`getDevicePushTokenAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getdevicepushtokenasync-devicepushtoken).

```diff
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
...
- const token = (await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()).data;
+ const token = (await Notifications.getDevicePushTokenAsync()).data;
// send token to your server
```

After getting the native device token, you can start implementing the servers. Below are some minimal examples of communicating with FCM and APNs:
