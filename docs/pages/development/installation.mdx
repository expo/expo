The installation steps on this page are only required to add the `expo-dev-client` library to a React Native or a bare project.

> To add the `expo-dev-client` library to an existing managed project, see [Create development builds](/development/create-development-builds/).

If you're starting your project, you can create a new project with our `with-dev-client` template. Run the following command to initialize the project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx crna -t with-dev-client']} />

Otherwise, if you already have an existing React Native or a bare project, follow the steps below to add `expo-dev-client` to it.

## 1. Set up Expo modules

If you created your project with `npx react-native init` and do not have any other Expo packages installed, **you'd need to [install Expo modules](/bare/installing-expo-modules)** before proceeding.

Otherwise, if you already have `expo` and/or other Expo modules up and running, you can skip this step.

## 2. Installation

Add the `expo-dev-client` library to your **package.json**:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab >

If your project has an **ios/** directory on disk, run the following command to fully install the native code for `expo-dev-client`:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

If your project doesn't have an **ios/** directory, you can skip this step.

</Tab >

<Tab >

### iOS

Add the following lines to your **Podfile**:

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/podfile.diff" />

Run the following command to install native code for the `expo-dev-client` via CocoaPods.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

Also, ensure that your project is configured to deploy on an iOS version _above 10_.
To do that, open Xcode, go to General > Deployment Info and select an iOS version of at least 11.0.

### Android

No additional changes are needed to install the package on Android.

## 3. Basic configuration

Development builds use deep links to open projects from the QR code. If you have added a custom deep link scheme to your project, your development build will use it. However, if this isn't the case, you need to configure the deep link support for your app. The `uri-scheme` package will do this for you once you have chosen a scheme.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx uri-scheme add <your scheme>']} />

For more information, see [uri-scheme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme).

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab >

No additional steps are needed to configure the package on SDK 45 and above.

</Tab >

<Tab >

### iOS

Add the following changes to allow the `expo-dev-client` library to control project initialization in the **DEBUG** mode.

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/app-delegate-expo-modules.diff" />

### Android

Add the following changes to allow the `expo-dev-client` library to control project initialization in the **DEBUG** mode.

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/main-activity-and-application-expo-modules.diff" />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## 4. Optional configuration

There are a few more changes you can make to get the best experience, but you [can skip ahead to building](/development/create-development-builds/#build-with-eas) if you prefer.

### Disable packager autostart when building for iOS

When you start your project on iOS, the metro bundler will start automatically. This behavior might not be ideal when you want to use `npx expo start`. Our recommended solution is to remove the `Start Packager` action from building scripts. To do that you need to open the Xcode, go to **Build Phases** and remove the **Start Packager** action.

<img src="/static/images/client/remove_start_packager.png" style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Add better error handlers

For certain type of errors, you can provide more helpful error messages. To turn this on, import import `expo-dev-client` in the project's **index** file (in the managed workflow, you need to add this import on top of the **App.&lbrace;js|tsx&rbrace;**). Make sure that the import statement is above `import App from './App'`.

```js
import 'expo-dev-client';
...
import App from "./App";
```

For more information, see [Error handling](/development/use-development-builds/#add-error-handling).

### Loading published updates

Development builds can also open and preview published updates to your app.

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab>

To add this feature, install `expo-updates` in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates']} />

After doing so, if your project has an **ios/** directory on disk, you will need to reinstall CocoaPods:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

</Tab>

<Tab>

To add this feature, add `expo-updates@0.8.0` or newer to your app if it isn't already installed, and add a small additional integration in your **AppDelegate.m** and **MainApplication.java** files.

1. [Install `expo-modules` in your project](/bare/installing-expo-modules).
2. [Install `expo-updates` in your project](/bare/installing-updates).
3. Add the following changes to complete the integration with `expo-updates`:

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/app-delegate-updates.diff" />

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/main-application-updates.diff" />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## 5. Build and install

You're now ready to [build your first development build](/development/create-development-builds/#build-with-eas).
