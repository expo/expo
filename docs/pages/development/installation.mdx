The installation steps on this page are only required to add the `expo-dev-client` library to a React Native or Bare project. To add the `expo-dev-client` library to an existing managed project, see our [Getting Started guide](getting-started.mdx).

If you're just starting your project, you can create a new project from our template with:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx crna -t with-dev-client']} />

Otherwise, follow this guide to add `expo-dev-client` to your existing React Native or Bare project.

## 1. Set up Expo modules

If you created your project with `npx react-native init` and do not have any other Expo packages installed, **you'll need to [install Expo modules](../bare/installing-expo-modules)** before proceeding.

If you created your project with `expo init` or `create-expo-app`, or you already have `expo` and/or other Expo modules up and running, you can skip this step.

## 2. Installation

Add the `expo-dev-client` library to your package.json.

<InstallSection
  packageName="expo-development-client"
  cmd={['npx expo install expo-dev-client']}
  hideBareInstructions
/>

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab >

If your project has an `ios` directory on disk, run the following command to fully install the native code for `expo-dev-client`:

<InstallSection
  packageName="expo-development-client"
  cmd={['npx pod-install']}
  hideBareInstructions
/>

If your project doesn't have an `ios` directory, you can skip this step.

</Tab >

<Tab >

### iOS

Add the following lines to your **Podfile**:

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/podfile.diff" />

Run the following command to install native code for the `expo-dev-client` via CocoaPods.

<InstallSection
  packageName="expo-development-client"
  cmd={['npx pod-install']}
  hideBareInstructions
/>

Also, make sure that your project is configured to deploy on an iOS version _above 10_.
To do that, open Xcode and go to General > Deployment Info, and select an iOS version of at least 11.0.

### Android

No additional changes are needed to install the package on Android.

## 3. Basic configuration

Development builds use deep links to open projects from the QR code. If you have added a custom deep link scheme to your project, your development build will use it. However, if this isn't the case, you need to configure the deep link support for your app. The `uri-scheme` package will do this for you once you have chosen a scheme.

<InstallSection
  packageName="expo-development-client"
  cmd={['npx uri-scheme add <your scheme>']}
  hideBareInstructions
/>

For more information, see [uri-scheme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme).

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab >

No additional steps are needed to configure the package on SDK 45 and above.

</Tab >

<Tab >

### iOS

Make the following changes to allow the `expo-dev-client` library to control project initialization in the **DEBUG** mode.

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/app-delegate-expo-modules.diff" />

### Android

Make the following changes to allow the `expo-dev-client` library to control project initialization in the **DEBUG** mode.

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/main-activity-and-application-expo-modules.diff" />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## 4. Optional configuration

There are a few more changes you can make to get the best experience, but you [can skip ahead to building](/development/getting-started/#building-and-installing-your-first-development-build) if you prefer.

### Disable packager autostart when building for iOS

When you start your project on iOS, the metro bundler will start automatically. This behavior might not be ideal when you want to use `npx expo start`. Our recommended solution is to remove the `Start Packager` action from building scripts. To do that you need to open the Xcode, go to "Build Phases" and remove the "Start Packager" action.

<img src="/static/images/client/remove_start_packager.png" style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />

### Add better error handlers

Sometimes, for certain types of errors, we can provide more helpful error messages than the ones that ship by default with React Native. To turn this feature on you need to import `expo-dev-client` in your **index** file (in the managed workflow, you need to add this import on top of the **App.&lbrace;js|tsx&rbrace;**). Make sure that the import statement is above `import App from './App'`.

```js
import 'expo-dev-client';
...
import App from "./App";
```

> Note: This will only affect the application in which you make this change. If you want to load multiple projects from a single development app, you'll need to add this import statement to each project.

### Loading published updates

Development builds can also open and preview published updates to your app.

<Tabs tabs={["SDK 45 and above", "SDK 44 and below"]}>

<Tab>

To add this feature, install `expo-updates` in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates']} />

After doing so, if your project has an `ios` directory on disk, you will need to reinstall CocoaPods:

<InstallSection
  packageName="expo-development-client"
  cmd={['npx pod-install']}
  hideBareInstructions
/>

</Tab>

<Tab>

To add this feature, add `expo-updates@0.8.0` or newer to your app if it isn't already installed, and add a small additional integration in your **AppDelegate.m** and **MainApplication.java** files.

1. [Install `expo-modules` in your project](../bare/installing-expo-modules.mdx).
2. [Install `expo-updates` in your project](../bare/installing-updates.mdx).
3. Make the following changes to complete the integration with `expo-updates`:

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/app-delegate-updates.diff" />

<DiffBlock source="/static/diffs/client/main-application-updates.diff" />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## 5. Build and Install

You're now ready to [build your first development build](/development/getting-started.mdx#creating-and-installing-your-first-development-build).
