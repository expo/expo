Updates generally fix small bugs and push small changes in between app store releases. They allow updating the non-native parts of our app, like JavaScript code, styling, and images.

In this chapter, we are going to use EAS Update to share changes with our team. This will help us and our team quickly share previews of the changes with each other.

<Step label="1">

## Install expo-updates library

To initialize our project and send an update, we need to use the expo-updates library. Run the following command to install it:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Configure EAS Update

To initialize our project with EAS Update, we need to:

- Since we are using dynamic **app.config.js** for our app's configuration, adding `updates` and `runtimeVersion` properties is required to make our project compatible with EAS Update. Run the following command to obtain these properties and their values from EAS and manually copy them to **app.config.js**:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

<Collapsible summary="What about non-dynamic (app.json) projects?">

If a project doesn't use dynamic app config (uses **app.json** instead of **app.config.js**), the above command will configure our app to be compatible with EAS Update and add the right properties to **app.json** and **eas.json**.

</Collapsible>

- Next, add a `channel` to every build profile in the **eas.json**. To automatically update this file, re-run the `eas update:configure` command:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "ios-simulator": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "ios-simulator"
    },
    "preview": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

<Collapsible summary="What is a channel?">

Channels are used to group builds together. If we have an Android and iOS build, both on the app store, we can give them both a channel of production. Later, we can tell EAS Update to target the production channel, so our update will affect all builds with a production channel.

</Collapsible>

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Create a development build

We need to create a new development build since our last build doesn't contain the expo-updates library. Run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --profile development']} />

> We are using a development build for Android devices to demonstrate updates. However, we can use `--platform all` or `--platform ios` to create a build for both platforms or just for iOS.

After the new version of the development build is created, make sure to install it on a device.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Modify the JavaScript code of the app

Let's update the text of the first button in our app that says **Choose a photo** to **Select a photo**.

```jsx App.js
<Button theme="primary" label="Select a photo" onPress={pickImageAsync} />
```

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Publish an update

Instead of creating a new build to share this change with our team for testing, let's publish an update:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --branch development --message "Change first button label"']} />

In the command above, we used the `development` branch. Every update is associated with an EAS update branch. It is similar to every commit that we make with git, which is associated with a git branch.

By default, EAS will map branches and channels with the same name, if no other mapping has been specified. So, by using the channel `development` in our build profile and then publishing an update on the development branch, we’re asking EAS to deliver this update to builds with the `development` channel. When we make an EAS Update branch, we can map it to a channel.

After the update is published, the CLI will prompt us with information about it.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="EAS Update published successfully with CLI prompt"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/update-01.png"
/>

Click on the website link to see the Update on the Expo dashboard under **Updates**:

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Expo dashboard shows the latest published update for the development build"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/update-02.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
/>

</Step>

<Step label="6">

## See the update live in a development build

To view the live update in a development build:

- Log in to your Expo account within the development build.
- Open the **Extensions** tab.
- Look for **Branch: development** listed under **EAS Update**.
- Tap on **Open** to access the update.

</Step>

<Step label="7">

## Sharing changes with preview or production builds

Updates for non-development builds (preview or production) are automatically downloaded to the device when the app starts up and makes a request for any new updates.

Any team member running the preview or production build will receive the update with the changes we push to those specific branches.

For example, for a `preview` build, we can run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --branch preview --message "Change first button label"']} />

Here is an example where we've published an update for the `preview` build. To test the update, force close and reopen the app twice to download and view the changes:

<Video file="tutorial/eas/running-update-on-dev.mp4" />

</Step>

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Installed the `expo-updates` library and configured EAS Update in our project.
- The `channel` property in the build profiles establishes a link between a build and an update.
- Learned how channels are used to group builds of different platforms together and create a target for updates.
- Updates allow us to deliver changes to the non-native layer of our apps, such as JavaScript changes.
- Published updates using `eas update --branch development --message "Change description"`.
- Used a development build to view updates by logging into an Expo account and accessing the update through the Extensions tab.
- Published updates that affect preview and production builds. We also learned that they fetch and download new updates when the app opens, which requires us to force close and reopen the app a second time to see the update applied. We can also extend this behavior to programmatically control the behavior of available updates by using [`useUpdates()`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/#useupdates)` hook.

OTA updates help fix bugs, push quick updates between app store submissions, and ease the process of sharing them with our team members while the app is in development. In this chapter, we:

- Installing the `expo-updates` library and configuring EAS Update in our project.
- The `channel` property in the build profiles establishes a link between a build and an update.
- The ability to make and publish modifications to the JavaScript code in our app as new updates without necessitating a new build, leveraging the convenience of OTA updates.
- Published updates using `eas update --branch development --message "Change description"`.
- Used a development build to view updates by logging in to the Expo account and accessing the update through the Extensions tab.
- How preview and production builds automatically download updates, and force reopen the app to see the changes. We can also extend this behavior to programmatically control the behavior of available updates by using
