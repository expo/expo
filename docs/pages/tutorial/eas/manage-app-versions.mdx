In this chapter, we'll learn how EAS Build automatically manages the developer-facing app version for Android and iOS. Learning about it will be useful before we dive into production build in the next two chapters.

## Understanding developer-facing and user-facing app versions

An app version is composed of two values:

- Developer-facing value: Represented by [`versionCode`](/versions/latest/config/app/#versioncode) for Android and [`buildNumber`](/versions/latest/config/app/#buildnumber) for iOS.
- User-facing value: Represented by [`version`](/versions/latest/config/app/#version) **app.config.js**.

Both Google Play Store and Apple App Store rely on developer-facing values to identify each unique build. For example, if we upload an app with the app version `1.0.0 (1)` (which is a combination of user-facing and developer-facing values), we cannot submit another build to the app stores with the same app version. Submitting builds with duplicate app version numbers results in a failed submission.

An example demonstration of manually managing developer-facing values is shown below by `android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber` in **app.config.js**. **We don't have to add or manage these values manually since EAS Build automates this for us**.

```js app.config.js
{
  ios: {
    buildNumber: 1
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  android: {
    versionCode: 1
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

> **Note**: The [user-facing version number](/build-reference/app-versions/#user-facing-version) is not handled by EAS. Instead, we define that in the app store developer portals before submitting our production app for review.

## Automatic app version management with EAS Build

By default, EAS Build assists in automating developer-facing values. It utilizes the [remote version source](/build-reference/app-versions/#remote-version-source) to automatically increment developer-facing values whenever a new production release is made.

When we initialized the project with `eas init` command, the EAS CLI automatically added the following properties in **eas.json**:

- `cli.appVersionSource` which is set to `remote`
- [`build.production.autoIncrement`](/eas/json/#autoincrement-1) which is set to `true`

You can view them in your project's **eas.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    /* @info The <CODE>appVersionSource</CODE> is set to <CODE>remote</CODE>. */
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
    /* @end */
  },
  "build": {
    "production": {
      /* @info The <CODE>autoIncrement</CODE> is set <CODE>true</CODE> to automatically increment the <CODE>versionCode</CODE> or <CODE>buildNumber</CODE>. */
      "autoIncrement": true
      /* @end */
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

When we create a new production build in the next two chapters, the `versionCode` for Android and `buildNumber` for iOS will increment automatically.

<Collapsible summary="Syncing developer-facing app versions for already published apps to EAS">

If your app is already published in the app stores, the developer-facing app versions are already set. When migrating this app to use EAS Build, follow the steps below to sync those app versions:

- In the terminal window, run the `eas build:version:set` command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build:version:set']} />

- Select the platform (Android or iOS) when prompted.
- When prompted **Do you want to set app version source to remote now?**, select **yes**. This will set the `cli.appVersionSource` to `remote` in **eas.json**.
- When prompted **What version would you like to initialize it with?**, enter the last version number that you have set in the app stores.

After these steps, the app versions will be synced to EAS Build remotely. You can set `build.production.autoIncrement` to `true` in **eas.json**. When you create a new production build, the `versionCode` and `buildNumber` will be automatically incremented from now on.
