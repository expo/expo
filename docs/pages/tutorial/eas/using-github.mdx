[Expo GitHub App](/build/building-from-github/) automatically triggers builds from our GitHub projects with EAS. We can trigger builds for any build profile based on our development team's preferences. It also allows triggering builds for `git` push committed directly to a repository or a pull request.

In this chapter, we're to configure this functionality. We already have a GitHub repository for our example app to demonstrate this.

<Step label="1">

## Configure Expo GitHub app

To use this functionality, we need to connect our GitHub account:

- In the Expo dashboard navigation menu, under **Account settings**, click **GitHub**. This opens the **Connect GitHub** accounts page.
- Click the **Get started** button which opens a popup to authorize the Expo GitHub app. Click **Install & Authorize**.
- Once the app is installed on our GitHub account, we need to link it to our Expo account. In the next popup, click **Link installation**.
- Once the account is linked, it will show under **GitHub accounts**.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Connect the GitHub repository

To enable triggering builds from a GitHub repository, we need to connect it to our project in the Expo dashboard:

- Open the project from the navigation menu under **Project settings**, and click **GitHub**.
- Under **Connect a GitHub repository**, we'll see a list of our GitHub repos. We need to connect the right one. In the example, we're searching for our repo **sticker-smash.**

- Click **Connect** for the project repository.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Configure repository settings in the Expo dashboard

The Expo GitHub app needs to know where to find the source code of our project. By default, it selects the root directory using `/`. In our example project, the source code is also available in the root repository.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Trigger a build using a GitHub PR label

The Expo GitHub app provides us [multiple options](/build/building-from-github/#trigger-a-build-from-github) to trigger a build, such as:

- Manually from the Builds page for a specific platform
- Automatically when new code is pushed to the repository
- Automatically using GitHub PR labels

To automatically trigger a build using a GitHub PR label, we're going to utilize the third option from the list above:

- We need to specify the build image that we will be using. Open **eas.json**, and under the `development` profile, add [`android.image`](/eas/json/#image) and [`ios.image`](/eas/json/#image-1) properties and set their value to [`latest`](/build-reference/infrastructure/#configuring-build-environment).

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      /* @info */
      "android": {
        "image": "latest"
      },
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
      /* @end */
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

- Next, modify our app's JavaScript code. We create a git branch called `dev` and submit a PR to our example repository from that branch.
- In the PR link, under **Labels**, create a label called `eas-build-all:development`.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Creating a label in a GitHub PR"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/github-04.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 320 }}
/>

- Click **Create pull request** button to create the PR. The Expo GitHub app will start the process of creating a development build.

  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

- In the Expo dashboard, on the **Builds** page, we can verify that the builds for both Android and iOS are triggered.

<ImageSpotlight

  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/github-06.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
/>

- If we check the details of an individual build, we can see under **Created by** that the build is created by the GitHub app.

</Step>

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Connected and authorized our GitHub account with Expo.
- Linked our GitHub repository to our EAS project.
- Automated creating builds by applying GitHub PR labels.
