Updates generally fix small bugs and push small changes in between app store releases. They allow updating the non-native parts of our app, such as JavaScript code, styling, and images.

In this chapter, we're going to use [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/) to share changes with our team. This will help [us and our team quickly share previews](/eas-update/develop-faster/) of the change.

<Step label="1">

## Install expo-updates library

To initialize our project and send an update, we need to use the [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) library. Run the following command to install it:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Configure EAS Update

To initialize our project with EAS Update, we need to follow these steps:

- Since we are using dynamic **app.config.js** for our app's configuration, adding [`updates`](/versions/latest/config/app/#updates) and [`runtimeVersion`](/eas-update/runtime-versions/#setting-runtimeversion) properties are required to make our project compatible with EAS Update. Run the following command to obtain these properties and their values from EAS and manually copy them to **app.config.js**:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

<Collapsible summary="What about non-dynamic (app.json) projects?">

If a project doesn't use dynamic app config (uses **app.json** instead of **app.config.js**), the above command will configure our app to be compatible with EAS Update and add the right properties to **app.json** and **eas.json**.

</Collapsible>

- Re-run `eas update:configure` to continue with the setup process. A [`channel`](/eas/json/#channel) should be added to every build profile in **eas.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "ios-simulator": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "ios-simulator"
    },
    "preview": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

> **info** **Tip**: Notice that the `eas update:configure` command adds the `channel` to every build profile in **eas.json**. However, our `ios-simulator` profile extends the `development` profile and having a separate `channel` doesn't make sense. We can safely remove `ios-simulator.channel` from the above configuration.

<Collapsible summary="What is a channel?">

[Channels](/eas-update/how-it-works/#conceptual-overview) are used to group builds together. If we have an Android and iOS build, both on the app store, we can give them both a channel of production. Later, we can tell EAS Update to target the production channel, so our update will affect all builds with a production channel.

</Collapsible>

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Create a development build

We need to create a new development build since our last build doesn't contain the `expo-updates` library. Run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --profile development']} />

> We are using a development build for Android devices to demonstrate updates. However, we can use `--platform all` or `--platform ios` to create a build for both platforms or just for iOS.

After the new version of the development build is created, make sure to install it on a device.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Modify the JavaScript code of the app

Let's update the text of the first button in our app that says **Choose a photo** to **Select a photo**.

```jsx App.js
<Button theme="primary" label="Select a photo" onPress={pickImageAsync} />
```

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Publish an update

Instead of creating a new build to share this change with our team for testing, let's publish an update:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --branch development --message "Change first button label"']} />

In the command above, we used the `development` branch. Every update is associated with an [update branch](/eas-update/how-it-works/#publishing-an-update). It is similar to every commit that we make with git, which is associated with a git branch.

By default, EAS will map branches and channels with the same name, if no other mapping has been specified. So, by using the channel `development` in our build profile and then publishing an update on the development branch, we're asking EAS to deliver this update to builds with the `development` channel. When we make an EAS Update branch, we can map it to a channel.

After the update is published, the CLI will prompt us with information about it.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="EAS Update published successfully with CLI prompt"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/update-01.png"
/>

Click on the website link to see the Update on the Expo dashboard under **Updates**:

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Expo dashboard shows the latest published update for the development build"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/update-02.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 800 }}
/>

</Step>

<Step label="6">

## Preview the update live in a development build

To preview the live update in a development build:

- Log in to your Expo account within the development build.
- Open the **Extensions** tab.
- Look for **Branch: development** listed under **EAS Update**.
- Tap on **Open** to access the update.

</Step>

<Step label="7">

## Sharing changes with preview or production builds

Updates for non-development builds (preview or production) are automatically downloaded to the device when the app starts up and makes a request for any new updates.

Any team member running the preview or production build will receive the update with the changes we push to those specific branches.

For example, for a `preview` build, we can run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --branch preview --message "Change first button label"']} />

Here is an example where we've published an update for the `preview` build. To test the update, force close and reopen the app twice to download and view the changes:

<Video file="tutorial/eas/running-update-on-dev.mp4" />

</Step>

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Installed the `expo-updates` library and configured EAS Update in our project.
- The `channel` property in the build profiles establishes a link between a build and an update.
- Learned how channels are used to group builds of different platforms and create a target for updates.
- Updates allow us to deliver changes to the non-native layer of our apps, such as JavaScript changes.
- Published updates using `eas update --branch development --message "Change description"`.
- Used a development build to view updates by logging into an Expo account and accessing the update through the Extensions tab.
- Published updates that affect preview and production builds. We also learned that they fetch and download new updates when the app opens, which requires us to force close and reopen the app a second time to see the update applied. We can also extend this behavior to programmatically control the behavior of available updates by using [`useUpdates()`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/#useupdates) hook.
