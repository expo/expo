In this chapter, let's create our development build for Android devices and emulators with EAS Build.

## Trigger a build

For Android devices or emulators, the process of creating and running a build remains the same. The only difference comes during the installation of the development build on each platform.

<Step label="1">

## Create a build for development profile

For Android devices or emulators, the development build must be in the **.apk** file format. While the default Android format is **.aab**, which is ideal for Google Play Store distribution, it cannot be directly installed on devices or emulators.

To create a **.apk**, make sure:

- The `developmentClient` is set to `true` in **eas.json**, which is the default configuration.
- Then, execute `eas build` command with `android` as the platform and `development` as the build profile:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --profile development']} />

> **info** **Tip**: Next time you run `eas build` command, you can also use `-p` to specify the platform. It is short for `--platform`.

This command prompts us with the following questions:

- **What would you like your Android application id to be?** Press <kbd>return</kbd> to select the default value provided for this prompt.
- **Generate a new Android Keystore**? Press <kbd>Y</kbd>.

<Collapsible summary="What is an Android application ID?">

Also known as the package name of our Android app, it stores the value in DNS reverse notation format (`com.owner.app-name`). Each component of this notation should start with a lowercase letter.

For example, our example app has `com.owner-name.stickersmash` where `com.owner-name` is the domain and `stickermsash` is our app name.

</Collapsible>

When we answer these prompts, the EAS CLI updates the [`android.package`](/versions/latest/config/app/#package) property in **app.json**. After responding to the prompts, our EAS Build is queued, and the EAS CLI provides a link to view build details and track progress on the Expo dashboard.

<Collapsible summary="What information does a build details page contain?">

The build details page displays the build type, profile, Expo SDK version, app version, version code, last commit hash, and the identity of the developer or account owner who initiated the build.

In the **Build artifact** section, the current status shows that the build is in progress. Upon completion, this section will offer an option to download the build. The **Logs** section outlines every step taken during the Android build process on EAS Build. For the sake of brevity, we won't explore each step in detail here. To learn more, see [Android build process](/build-reference/android-builds/).

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Install development build on Android device

Once the build finishes, the **Build artifact** section gets updated, indicating that the build is complete:

/>

This section provides the methods available for running the development build on an Android device, including:

- Open with Expo Orbit (macOS only)
- Install button

### Using Expo Orbit

[Expo Orbit](https://github.com/expo/orbit) allows for seamless installation of the development build on an Android device. To use this method:

- Connect our Android device to our local machine using USB.
- Open the Orbit menu bar app.
- Select the **Device** in the Orbit app.

<ImageSpotlight

  style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
/>

- On the Expo dashboard, under **Build artifact**, click the **Open with Orbit**.

After the build is installed, the Orbit app launches the development build on the device.

### Using Install button

The **Install** button in the **Build artifact** section generates a QR code for easy installation:

- Click **Install** to display a popup with the QR code.

  style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
/>

- Scan the QR code with our Android device's camera to open the build link in the default web browser.
- Tap the **Install** button on the webpage to download the **.apk** file.
- Once downloaded, open the **.apk** file to start the installation process.
- If an **Unsafe app blocked message** appears, select **Install anyway**. This warning can safely be ignored as the source of the **.apk** (which we generated) is trusted.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Run development build on Android device

Start the development server by running `npx expo start` from the project directory:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

Press <kbd>a</kbd> in the terminal window to open the project on the Android device.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Install the development build on Android Emulator

In terminal, once the build finishes, EAS CLI prompts us by asking whether we want to run the build on an Android Emulator. Press <kbd>Y</kbd>.

<Collapsible summary="Using Expo Orbit">

Alternatively, Expo Orbit can be used for installation. From **Build artifact** on the Expo dashboard, click **Open with Expo Orbit** to install the development build on the Android Emulator.

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Run the development build on Android Emulator

Start the development server by running `npx expo start` from the project directory:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

Press <kbd>a</kbd> in the terminal window to open the project on the Android Emulator.

</Step>

- Creating and executing a cloud build using EAS Build for Android.
- The difference between the **.apk** and **.aab** file formats for Android.
