In this chapter, we're going to our app's production version and submit it for testing using TestFlight. After that, we'll submit them for App Store review to get it on the App Store.

## Prerequisites

To submit an app, we need a paid Apple Developer account. To create one, see [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

## What is a production build

A production iOS build is optimized for Apple's App Store Connect, which allows distributing builds to testers with TestFlight and public end users through the App Store. This build type cannot be side-loaded on a simulator or device and can only be distributed through App Store Connect.

<Step label="1">

## Required EAS configuration

The only required configuration to create our production build for iOS is to have `production` build profile in **eas.json** which is added by default.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Create a distribution provisioning profile

Run `eas credentials` command in the terminal and then answer the following prompts by EAS CLI:

- **Select platform** iOS.
- **Which build profile do you want to configure?** Select production.
- **Do you want to log in to your Apple account?** Press <kbd>Y</kbd>. This will log in to our Apple Developer account.
- **What do you want to do?** Select **Build credentials** and choose **All: Set up all the required credentials to build your project**.
- Now, it will prompt whether we want to re-use the previous Distribution Certificate. Press <kbd>Y</kbd>.
- **Generate a new Apple Provisioning Profile?** Press <kbd>Y</kbd>. This will be the provisioning profile for the production app.
- Press any key to exit the EAS CLI.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Create a production build

To create an iOS production build, open the terminal and run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios']} />

The `production` profile in EAS configuration is the default profile. We don't have to pass it using the `--profile` flag.

The command will queue the build. Also, notice on the Expo dashboard that the **Build Number** is auto-incremented.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Submit the app binary to App Store

To submit the app binary created from our latest EAS Build, run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform ios']} />

After running this command, we need to:

- **Select a build from EAS.** Let's select the latest build ID.
- **Follow the prompt to log in to our Apple account.** When it asks for **Reuse this App Store Connect API Key?** Press <kbd>Y</kbd>.

This will trigger the submission process.

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Release an internal testing version

After the submission process is complete, we'll need to log in to the Apple Developer account from the web browser.

- Click **[Apps](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps),** and see the app icon.
- Click the app name, and from the navigation tab menu, click **TestFlight**. If the build was just submitted, it may take a few minutes for Apple to process the build before it is available to distribute with TestFlight.
- Click on the **Manage Compliance** link. Since our app doesn't use any encryption, select **None of the algorithms mentioned above**.

> **info** **Tip:** Next time when creating an app, skip this compliance by adding [`ios.config.usesNonExemptEncryption`](/versions/latest/config/app/#usesnonexemptencryption) in app config and set it to `false` if the app doesn't use any encryption.

- In App Store Connect, under **Internal Testing**, and create a test group. This will allow us to invite test users.

  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

- Once the group is created, an email will be sent to all the test users.

<ImageSpotlight

  style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
/>

- In the email, click **View in TestFlight,** accept the invite, and then tap **Install**.

<ImageSpotlight

/>

After that, the app will download on our device so that we can test it.

> **Note**: Similar to internal testing, we can also create a group for inviting external testers using TestFlight. Where internal testing has a limit of 100 users, TestFlight allows sharing a test release version externally with up to 10,000 testers and provides a publicly shareable link. For brevity, we are not going to cover those steps in this tutorial.

</Step>

<Step label="6">

## Submit the app to the Apple App Store

To prepare our app for App Store submission, go to the **App Store** tab:

- Provide metadata details, provide screenshots as per Apple's guidelines and also fill details under **General**.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="App Store Connect showing the app details and screenshots"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/eas/app-store-04.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

- Then, manually select the build.

/>

> **Complete App Store listing**: To prepare the app for store listing, see our [Create app store assets guide](/guides/store-assets/) on how to create screenshots and previews.

- Once our app is ready, click on **Submit to App Review**. After that, Apple will review our app, and if approved, the app will be available on the App Store.

</Step>

<Step label="7">

## Automated submissions

For future releases, we can streamline the process by combining build creation and App Store submission into a single step by using the `--auto-submit` flag with `eas build`:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --auto-submit']} />

</Step>

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned about:

- Creating an App Store-ready build by making a build with the `production` build profile.
- Distributing a production build using TestFlight or the Apple App Store.
- Submitting the app to the App Store using `eas submit`.
- Automating the submission process using the `--auto-submit` flag with `eas build`.
