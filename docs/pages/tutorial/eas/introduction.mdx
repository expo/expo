In this tutorial, we'll take our app built in the [previous tutorial](/tutorial/introduction/), create a development build and a preview version, and deploy it to the app stores.

## What will you learn in this tutorial

The objective of this tutorial is to give you basic proficiency [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) core services: [Build](/build/introduction/), [Submit](/submit/introduction/), and [Update](/eas-update/introduction/). The following topics are covered:

- Use EAS Build to create and install a development build, then run it on a device, emulator, or simulator.
- Discover the benefits of using a development build instead of Expo Go.
- Implement workflows for sharing development builds with a team or external stakeholders.
- Automatically increment app build versions.
- Simultaneously install different app variants, like development and preview, on one device.
- Utilize EAS Update to create and deploy updates swiftly during the development phase.
- Automate build processes by integrating with a GitHub repository.

These topics will give us the foundation needed to use EAS effectively and to approach more advanced topics when needed.

## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial emphasizes learning by doing. It is self-paced and can take up to two to three hours to complete. To follow along, you can use your own project if you have it already, or you can choose one of the following options:

- Use the Sticker Smash app from the previous tutorial. If you haven't followed the previous tutorial, download the complete source code from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/sticker-smash-expo-tutorial-app) and set the project on your local machine. **We're going to use this as our example app**.
- Create a new project with [`npx create-expo-app`](/get-started/create-a-project/).
- Create and use a project generated by React Native CLI (also known as bare React Native project). It will contain the native directories (**android** and **ios**). You'll have to install the `expo` package (either [automatically](/bare/installing-expo-modules/) or [manually](/bare/installing-expo-modules/#manual-installation)) in the project before you proceed.

## Optional tools

It might be useful to run the example app locally using either an Android Emulator or an iOS Simulator. To install and setup these tools on your local machine, take a look at the following guides:

- [Set up Android Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Set up iOS Simulator](/workflow/ios-simulator/) (available only on macOS)
- [Expo Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit) to manage and launch builds with one click.

> **Note**: This is not a requirement to follow this tutorial since we are also going to run our apps on real devices. You can skip those steps where it uses an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

## Code

While we'll only modify our project's code one or two times, our emphasis will be on configuration and setup files. In this tutorial, example configurations will be <Highlight>highlighted in yellow </Highlight>. To get additional details about these highlights, hover over them on the desktop or tap on mobile.

## Next step

We're ready for this journey after setting up an Expo project locally.
