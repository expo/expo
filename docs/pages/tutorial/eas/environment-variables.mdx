This is an example workflow for using environment variables in EAS, that can ensure smooth development and deployment experience and can be used as a starting point for your project.
Let's assume you have a project with the following environment variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MY_NEW_FEATURE` - [`EXPO_PUBLIC_`](/guides/environment-variables/) variable that enables a new feature in your app
- `AUTH_TOKEN` - a variable that holds a build-time secret token for your app, like [`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`](/guides/using-sentry/#app-configuration)
- `APP_VARINT` - a variable to select an [app variant](/tutorial/eas/multiple-app-variants/)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` - a file variable to supply your gitignored `google-services.json` file to the build job
