In [Environment variables in EAS](/pages/eas/environment-variables) we described concepts related to using environment variables in EAS and differences in handling them by Expo CLI and EAS CLI.
This guide will show you how to use environment variables in EAS with practical examples.

In this example we will consider a sample app that fetches data from an API server and uses these common environment variables during the build process and for configuration purposes:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` - [`EXPO_PUBLIC_`](/guides/environment-variables/) variable that holds the URL of the API server
- `NPM_TOKEN` - a variable that holds a build-time secret token for your app, like [`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`](/guides/using-sentry/#app-configuration) or `NPM_TOKEN`
- `APP_VARINT` - a variable to select an [app variant](/tutorial/eas/multiple-app-variants/)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` - a file variable to supply your gitignored `google-services.json` file to the build job

Let's see how we can set up EAS environemnt variables for this example.

<Step label="1">
## Create environemnt variables

To create environment variables on EAS servers you can use [Environment Variables](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/environment-variables) page on the Expo website.

If you prefer using the command line, you can use the `eas env:create` command.

For this example let's create the following environment variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` with the value `https://staging.my-ap
