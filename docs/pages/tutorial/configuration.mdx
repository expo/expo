In this chapter, we'll address some app details before deploying our app to an app store, such as theming the statusbar, add a splash screen, and customizing the app icon.

<Step label="1">

## Configure the status bar

[`expo-status-bar`](/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/) library comes pre-installed in every project created using `create-expo-app`. This library provides a `setStatusBarStyle()` method to configure the app's status bar text color.

Inside **app/\_layout.tsx**:

1. Import `setStatusBarStyle` from `expo-status-bar` and `useEffect` from React.
2. Add the `useEffect` hook to set the status bar style to `light` when the app loads.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from "expo-router";
/* @tutinfo */
import { setStatusBarStyle } from "expo-status-bar";
import { useEffect } from "react";
/* @end */

export default function RootLayout() {
  /* @tutinfo Add the <CODE>useEffect</CODE> hook to set the status bar style to <CODE>light</CODE> when the app loads. */
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setStatusBarStyle("light");
    }, 0);
  }, []);
  /* @end */

  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
    </Stack>
  );
}

// ...rest of the import statements remain same
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';

export default function Index() {
  // ...rest of the code remains same

  return (
    <>
      <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>
        {/* ...rest of the code remains same */}
      </GestureHandlerRootView>
      /* @tutinfo Mount the <CODE>StatusBar</CODE> component and set the <CODE>style</CODE> prop to <CODE>light</CODE>. */
      <StatusBar style="light" />
      /* @end */
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's take a look at our app now on Android, and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="StatusBar with light style shown on both Android and iOS."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/statusbar-example.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Splash screen

A splash screen is visible before the app's content is loaded. It hides once the app's content is ready to be displayed.

Setting the `"splash.image"` property with a valid file path in the [**app.json**](/workflow/configuration/) file configures a splash screen. By default, a new Expo project already sets this property to a placeholder splash image. We already have **splash.png** in the **assets/images** directory. It looks as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight
  src="/static/images/tutorial/splash.png"
  alt="Custom splash screen used in example app."
  className="max-w-[250px]"
/>

Let's take a look at our app now on Android and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight file="tutorial/splash-screen.mp4" />

<Collapsible summary="Is the app loading too quickly for you to get a good look at the splash screen?">

You can display the splash screen for longer intervals. Run the following command to install `expo-splash-screen`, a library that provides a `preventAutoHideAsync()` method to delay hiding the splash screen:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-splash-screen']} />

Add the following code in **app/\_layout.tsx** to delay hiding the splash screen for five seconds.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
setTimeout(SplashScreen.hideAsync, 5000);
```

Don't forget to remove this code when you are done testing your splash screen.

</Collapsible>

Depending on the device's resolution, a white bar may be visible on the edges of an Android device's screen. To resolve this, set the `backgroundColor` for the splash screen in **app.json** to match the background in the splash image:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json app.json
{
  "splash": {
    "image": "./assets/images/splash.png",
    "resizeMode": "contain",
    /* @tutinfo Use #25292e (black) instead of the default #ffffff (white). */
    "backgroundColor": "#25292e" /* @end */
  }
}
```

The `backgroundColor` value in the above snippet matches the background of the splash screen image.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## App icon

Inside the project, there's an **icon.png** file inside the **assets/images** directory. This is our app icon. It's a 1024px by 1024px image and looks as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight src="/static/images/tutorial/icon.png" className="max-w-[150px]" />

Like the splash screen image, the `"icon"` property in the **app.json** file configures the app icon's path. By default, a new Expo project defines the correct path to `"./assets/images/icon.png"`. We don't have to change anything.

> Eventually, when you'll build your app for the app stores, [Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) will take this image and create optimized icon for every device.

You can see the icon in various places in Expo Go. Here is an example of the app icon displayed in the developer menu of Expo Go:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Splash screen on Developer Menu in Expo Go app."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/app-icon-visible.png"
  className="max-w-[250px]"
/>

</Step>
