## Configure the status bar

[`expo-status-bar`](/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/) library comes pre-installed in every project created using `create-expo-app`. This library provides a `StatusBar` component to configure the app's status bar style.

Inside **app/\_layout.tsx**:

1. Import `StatusBar` from `expo-status-bar`.
2. Group the `StatusBar` and existing `Stack` components with [React's Fragment component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from "expo-router";
/* @tutinfo */
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";
/* @end */

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    /* @tutinfo Group the `StatusBar` and existing `Stack` components with React's Fragment component. */
    <>
    /* @end */
      <Stack>
        <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
        <Stack.Screen name="+not-found" />
      </Stack>
      /* @tutinfo */<StatusBar style="light" />
    </>
    /* @end */
  );
}
```

Let's take a look at our app now on Android, and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="StatusBar with light style shown on both Android and iOS."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/statusbar-example.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## App icon

Inside the project, there's an **icon.png** file inside the **assets/images** directory. This is our app icon. It's a 1024px by 1024px image and looks as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight src="/static/images/tutorial/icon.png" className="max-w-[150px]" />

Like the splash screen image, the `"icon"` property in the **app.json** file configures the app icon's path. By default, a new Expo project defines the correct path to `"./assets/images/icon.png"`. We don't have to change anything.

> Eventually, when you'll build your app for the app stores, [Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) will take this image and create optimized icon for every device.

You can see the icon in various places in Expo Go. Here is an example of the app icon displayed in the developer menu of Expo Go:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Splash screen on Developer Menu in Expo Go app."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/app-icon-visible.png"
  className="max-w-[250px]"
/>

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Splash screen

A splash screen is visible before the app's content is loaded. It uses a smaller image, such as an app's icon, which is centered. It hides once the app's content is ready to be displayed.

The [`expo-splash-screen`](/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/) plugin already comes pre-installed in every project created using `create-expo-app`. This library provides a config plugin to configure the splash screen.

In **app.json**, the `expo-splash-screen` plugin is already configured to use the app's icon as the splash screen image with the following snippet so we don't have to change anything. Let's take a look at our app now on Android and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight file="tutorial/splash-screen.mp4" />

<Collapsible summary="Is the app loading too quickly for you to get a good look at the splash screen?">

You can display the splash screen for longer intervals by using `preventAutoHideAsync()` method from `expo-splash-screen` library. This method delays hiding the splash screen until you call `hideAsync()`.

Add the following code in **app/\_layout.tsx** to delay hiding the splash screen for five seconds.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
setTimeout(SplashScreen.hideAsync, 5000);
```

Don't forget to remove this code when you are done testing your splash screen.
