title: Tamagui ‚Äì The Best UI Kit for Expo
sidebar_title: Tamagui
---

Tamagui is a powerful, universal UI kit and styling library designed for **React Native and Web** ‚Äî making it an excellent choice for building Expo apps that are scalable, themeable, and fast.

## Why Tamagui?

Tamagui combines the best of component libraries and design systems. It's ideal for developers who want a high-performance UI layer with **cross-platform support** and **developer-friendly syntax**.

### ‚úÖ Pros

- **Universal components**: Write once, run on **iOS, Android, and Web** with consistent styling.
- **Built-in theming**: Supports **design tokens**, light/dark themes, and custom palettes out of the box.
- **Optimized performance**: Compiles styles at build time for near-native speed.
- **Great developer experience**: Styled-components-like syntax with TypeScript support.
- **Ecosystem tools**: Includes icon packs, animations, media queries, and responsive layouts.

### ‚ùå Cons

- **Learning curve**: New styling syntax and theming system may take time to adjust to.
- **Smaller community**: Compared to libraries like React Native Paper, Tamagui‚Äôs ecosystem is still growing.
- **Requires setup**: Needs additional configuration (especially for web support in Expo Router projects).

## When to use it

Tamagui is ideal for projects that:
- Need to target both **mobile and web** platforms.
- Aim to build a **custom design system** or theme-driven UI.
- Want high performance and smooth animations.

If you're building with **Expo + Expo Router**, Tamagui integrates well and unlocks the ability to write one UI layer across all platforms.
