A common concern for developers is how much space their app takes up on the app store. This guide will help you understand what different build artifacts are for, figure out the actual size of your app will be when distributed to users, and learn how to get insights into and optimize your app size.

## "Why is my app so big?"

**It probably isn't, actually!** When examining the resulting artifact of a release build for an app, it's common for developers who are unfamiliar with native Android and iOS development to be surprised by the file size â€” it's usually much larger than they would expect for an app of their scale if they were to download it from an app store. The reason is that **this is not actually the size of your app as it will be distributed on the app store!** When people talk about app sizes, what is relevant is the size of the app that they will download to their device, not the size that will be uploaded to app stores or shared in development and testing.

There are various types of build artifacts that serve different purposes, and they are almost all larger than what users will see when they download your app from a store. This is because these builds are not optimized to target specific devices like they would when downloading from a store, but rather they typically include all of the code and resources that your app needs to run on a wide range of devices.

## iOS apps

The download size on the App Store of a minimal React Native app is just under 4 MB.

There are two types of iOS build artifacts that you will interact with: APPs and IPAs.

### `.app` (iOS application bundle)

This is the actual application bundle for your app. When you download and install a build of your app into an iOS Simulator, you are downloading the `.app` bundle. These can either target specific architectures or be universal binaries. The size of your `.app` doesn't necessarily tell you too much about what the download size of your app will be on the store. You can't install a `.app` file directly to a physical iOS device.

### `.ipa` (iOS App Store Package)

IPA files are [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP)) files that include the `.app` bundle and other resources that are needed to run the app on an iOS device, and they are used for various types of distribution including App Store, Ad Hoc, Enterprise, and TestFlight. They include security and code signing information, such as the provisioning profile and entitlements. The App Store will take care of processing the IPA file and splitting it into smaller binaries for each device type, and so the size of the IPA also does not represent the download size of your app.

### Determining iOS app download and install size

Typically, what app developers care about the "download size" on the App Store (what the users see in the store listing when they go to download the app). This will be the size of the split IPA that is generated by the store from your universal IPA.

The only truly accurate way to see what your final app size will be shipped to users is to upload your app to the stores and download on a physical device. You can get accurate estimates from TestFlight: on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), navigate to TestFlight and select your build by clicking on the build number, then switch to the **Build Metadata** tab and click **App File Sizes**. You will see a list of estimated download and install sizes depending on the device type. Actually install sizes may also vary slightly depending on the iOS version on the device.

## Android apps

{/* todo: add info about minimum size of Android app on store */}

There are two types of Android build artifacts that you will interact with: APKs and AABs.

### `.apk` (Android Package)

When you build an APK with Gradle in a React Native project, the default behavior is to create a universal binary, which contains all the resources for all the different device types that your app supports. For example, it includes asset for every screen size, every CPU architecture, and every language, even though a single device will only need one of each. This means you can share this one file with anybody to install directly to their device, perhaps with [Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit) or `adb` directly, and that will work.

Of course, if you're running an incredibly popular app store that serves millions of users, you don't want to send the same 50 MB file to every single user, especially if they're only going to use a fraction of the resources in the APK. This is why the Google Play Store and other app stores have a feature called "App Bundles" (Android) that allows you to upload a single binary and then the store will generate a custom binary for each user based on their device's needs.

### `.aab` (Android App Bundle)

On Android, all new apps submitted to the Play Store must be built as an [Android App Bundle (.aab)](https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle). Only once you have submitted the binaries to their respective stores will you be able to see the download size for various different device types.

### Determining Android app download and install size

Typically, what app developers care about the "download size" on the Play Store (what the users see in the store listing when they go to download the app). This will be the size of the APK that Google Play generates from your AAB, which is tailored to the user's device.

The only truly accurate way to see what your final app size will be shipped to users is to upload your app to the stores and download on a physical device. Google Play also provides a reliable estimate for the expected download size on your developer dashboard. You can find this under the **App size** page in **Android vitals** on the [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/console/) .[Learn more](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859372?hl=en).

<Collapsible summary="Why did my APK size increase after upgrading to React Native 0.73?">

React Native 0.73, which is used in Expo SDK 50, bumped the Android `minSdkVersion` to `23`. This had the side effect of changing the default value of [`extractNativeLibs`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#extractNativeLibs`) to `false`.

> If set to "false", your native libraries are stored uncompressed in the APK. Although your APK might be larger, your application loads faster because the libraries load directly from the APK at runtime.

The following table shows that while the APK size increased, which may slightly impact download time for testers with [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/), the Google Play Store size remained the same.

| SDK | APK (debug variant) | APK (release variant) | AAB     | Google Play |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| 49  | 66 MB               | 27.6 MB               | 28.2 MB | 11.7 MB     |
| 50  | 168.1 MB            | 62.1 MB               | 27.4 MB | 11.7 MB     |

If you would like to revert back to the previous behavior, you can set `useLegacyPackaging` to `true` in your **gradle.properties** or by using [`expo-build-properties`](/versions/latest/sdk/build-properties/).

## Optimizing app size

As you add features to your app, you will be adding code, libraries, and assets, and therefore increase its size. If app size is important to you and your users, you may want to routinely review your app size and optimize it. The following sections will help you understand what you can do to optimize several different aspects of your app.

### Static assets

One of the most common sources of app size bloat is assets, such as fonts, icons, images, videos, and sounds. These can come from the assets that you import directly in your code and also JavaScript and native libraries, so you won't be able to get a complete picture by just reviewing your app assets directory.

Start by examining a build artifact to determine what assets are included in it. You can use [Android APK Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/apk-analyzer) or [apktool](https://apktool.org/) to inspect the contents of an Android app, and you can rename an IPA file from `app.ipa` to `app.zip` and extract it to examine the contents, using the macOS utility `assetutil` to inspect **Assets.car**.

### JavaScript bundle size

To analyze JavaScript bundles, [use Expo Atlas](/guides/analyzing-bundles/). You may find libraries that you thought were very small actually have a large impact on the bundle, or that you forgot to remove a library after you stopped using it, and so on.

### Platform-specific optimizations

Independent of React Native and Expo, you can optimize your app for Android and iOS by using the following tools:
