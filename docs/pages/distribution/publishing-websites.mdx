A web app created using Expo can be served locally for testing out the production behavior. Once the testing phase checks out, you can choose from a variety of third-party services to host it.

## Create a build

Creating a build of the project is the first step to publishing a web app. Whether you want to serve it locally or host it on a third-party service, you'll need to export all JavaScript and assets of a project. This is known as a static bundle. It can be exported by running the following command:

<TabsGroup>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Expo Router">

Run the universal export command to compile the project for web:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo export -p web']} />

The resulting project files are located in the **dist** directory. Any files inside the **public** directory are also copied to the **dist** directory.

</Tab>

<Tab label="webpack">

Run the webpack export command to compile the project for web:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo export:web']} />

The resulting project files are in the **web-build** directory. Any files inside the **web** directory are also copied to the **web-build** directory.

If you make changes to your project, you'll need to rebuild it for production. Don't edit the **web-build** directory directly.

> **Tip:** If you want to serve your site in a subfolder, add its path to your **package.json** as shown below:
>
> ```json package.json
> {
>   "homepage": "/path/to/subfolder"
> }
> ```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Serve Locally

Use [Serve CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to quickly test locally how your website will be hosted in production. Run the following command to serve the static bundle:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Expo Router">

If you're using [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering), then you can serve the static bundle with the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx serve dist']} />

Otherwise, use the `--single` flag to redirect all requests to the single **dist/index.html** file.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx serve dist --single']} />

Open [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000) to see your project in action. This method is **HTTP only**, so permissions, camera, location, and many other secure features won't work.

</Tab>

<Tab label="webpack">

Run the following command to serve the single-page application:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx serve web-build --single']} />

Open [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000) to see your project in action. This method is **HTTP only**, so permissions, camera, location, and many other things won't work.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Hosting on third-party services

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a mostly-unopinionated platform for deploying web apps. This has the highest compatibility with Expo web apps as it makes few assumptions about the framework.

#### Manual deployment with the Netlify CDN

<Step label="1">

Install the Netlify CLI by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g netlify-cli']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Configure redirects for single-page applications.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Expo Router">

> If your app uses [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering), then you can skip this step.

`expo.web.output: 'single'` generates a single-page application. It means there's only one **dist/index.html** file to which all requests must be redirected. This can be done in Netlify by creating a **./public/\_redirects** file and redirecting all requests to **/index.html**.

```sh public/_redirects
/*    /index.html   200
```

If you modify this file, you must rebuild your project with `npx expo export -p web` to have it safely copied into the **dist** directory.

</Tab>

<Tab label="webpack">

If your app implements any navigation, you'll need to configure Netlify to redirect requests to the single **web-build/index.html** file. This can be done in Netlify by creating a **./public/\_redirects** file and redirecting all requests to **/index.html**.

Navigate inside the **web-build** directory and run the following command to create **\_redirects** file with follwing rule:

```sh web/_redirects
/*    /index.html   200
```

If you modify this file, you must rebuild your project with `npx expo export:web` to have it safely copied into the **web-build** directory.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Deploy the web build folder by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Expo Router">
    <Terminal cmd={['$ netlify deploy --dir dist']} />
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="webpack">
    <Terminal cmd={['$ netlify deploy --dir web-build']} />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll see a URL that you can use to view your project online.

</Step>

#### Continuous delivery

Netlify can also build and deploy when you push to git or open a new pull request:

- [Start a new Netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup).
- Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository.
- Click **Build your site**.

### Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) has a single-command deployment flow.

<Step label="1">

Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g vercel@latest']} />

</Step>
<Step label="2">
  Configure redirects for single-page applications.
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Expo Router">

      Create a **vercel.json** file at the root of your app and add the following configuration:

      ```json vercel.json
      {
        "buildCommand": "expo export -p web",
        "outputDirectory": "dist",
        "devCommand": "expo",
        "cleanUrls": true,
        "framework": null,
        "rewrites": [
          {
            "source": "/:path*",
            "destination": "/"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      If your app uses [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering), then you may want to add additional [dynamic route configuration](/router/reference/static-rendering#dynamic-routes).

    </Tab>
    <Tab label="webpack">
      Create a **vercel.json** file at the root of your app and add the following:

      ```json vercel.json
      {
        "buildCommand": "expo export:web",
        "outputDirectory": "web-build",
        "devCommand": "expo",
        "cleanUrls": true,
        "framework": null,
        "rewrites": [
          {
            "source": "/:path*",
            "destination": "/"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
</Step>

<Step label="3">
  Deploy the website.
  
  <Terminal cmd={['$ vercel']} />

You'll now see a URL that you can use to view your project online. Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you'll see your deployed app.

</Step>

### AWS Amplify Console

The [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.amplify.aws) provides a Git-based workflow for continuously deploying and hosting full-stack serverless web apps. Amplify deploys your PWA from a repository instead of from your computer. In this guide, we'll use a GitHub repository. Before starting, [create a new repo on GitHub](https://github.com/new).

<Step label="1">

Add the [**amplify-explicit.yml**](https://github.com/expo/amplify-demo/blob/master/amplify-explicit.yml) file to the root of your repo.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Push your local Expo project to a GitHub repository. If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet, follow [GitHub's guide to add an existing project to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Login to the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) and choose **Get started** under **Deploy**. Grant Amplify permission to read from your GitHub account or the organization that owns your repo.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

The Amplify Console will detect that the **amplify.yml** file is in your repo. Choose **Next**.

</Step>

<Step label="5">

Review your settings and choose **Save and deploy**. Your app will now be deployed to a `https://branchname.xxxxxx.amplifyapp.com` URL.

</Step>

### GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to publish a website directly from a GitHub repository.

> **warning** Expo Router websites do not support deployment to GitHub Pages yet.

<Step label="1">

Start by initializing a new git repository in your project. If this is already done, skip this step.

If not then you'll want to run the following command in your project's root directory:

<Terminal cmd={['$ git init']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Add the GitHub repository as a `remote` in your local git repository.

<Terminal cmd={['$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/expo-gh-pages.git']} />

Running the above command makes git know to which repository you want to push your source code. It also makes the `gh-pages` package (installed in the next step) know where you want to deploy your app.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install the `gh-pages` package as a `dev-dependency` in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn add -D gh-pages']} />

</Step>

<Step label="4">

Configure your project's **package.json** for web hosting. Start by adding a `homepage` property. Set its value to the string `http://{username on GitHub}.github.io/{repo-name}`.

For example, if a GitHub username is called `dev` and the GitHub repository is `expo-gh-pages`, the following will be the value of the `homepage` property:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
{
  "homepage": "http://dev.github.io/expo-gh-pages"
}
```

In the same file, modify the `scripts` property by adding `predeploy` and `deploy` properties. Each has its own value as shown:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
"scripts": {
 /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d web-build",
  "predeploy": "expo export:web"
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="5">

To generate a production build of your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn deploy']} />

Your web app is now available at the URL you set as `homepage` in your **package.json**.

> When you publish code to your repository, for example: `gh-pages`, it will create and push the code to a branch in your repo. This branch will have your build code, however, not your development source code.

</Step>

### Firebase Hosting

[Firebase Hosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/) is production-grade web content hosting for web projects.

<Step label="1">

Create a firebase project with the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and install the Firebase CLI by following these [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Using the CLI, login to your Firebase account by running the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ firebase login']} />

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Then, initialize your firebase project to host by running the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ firebase init']} />

The settings will depend on how you built your Expo website:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Expo Router">

1. When asked about the public path, make sure to specify the **dist** directory.
2. When prompted **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)**, only select **Yes** if you used `web.output: "single"` (default). Otherwise, select **No**.

</Tab>
<Tab label="webpack">

When asked about the public path, make sure to specify the **web-build** directory. Also, when prompted **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)**, select **Yes**.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step label="4">

In the existing `scripts` property of **package.json**, add `predeploy` and `deploy` properties. Each has the following values:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Expo Router">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
"scripts": {
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  "predeploy": "expo export -p web",
  "deploy-hosting": "npm run predeploy && firebase deploy --only hosting",
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="webpack">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
"scripts": {
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  "predeploy": "expo export:web",
  "deploy-hosting": "npm run predeploy && firebase deploy --only hosting",
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step label="5">

To deploy, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run deploy-hosting']} />

Open the URL from the console output to check your deployment, for example: `https://project-name.firebaseapp.com`.

In case you want to change the header for hosting add the following config for `hosting` section in **firebase.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json firebase.json
  "hosting": [
    {
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "/**",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Cache-Control",
              "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|webp|js|css|eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|woff2|font.css)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Cache-Control",
              "value": "max-age=604800"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
    }
  ]
```

</Step>
