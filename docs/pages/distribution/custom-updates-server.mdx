title: Use expo-updates with a custom updates server
hideTOC: true
---

EAS (Expo Application Services) is the Expo team's cloud service that can host and serve updates for a React Native app using the `expo-updates` library. In some cases, you may prefer to use your servers and control how updates are sent to your app. To accomplish this, it's possible to implement your own custom Expo Updates server that will provide update manifests and assets to your end-users' apps.

The only requirement is that your custom server adheres to the [Expo Updates Protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1). To help get you started, we created a demo repo that implements the protocol that you could deploy and test: [Custom Expo Updates Server](https://github.com/expo/custom-expo-updates-server).
