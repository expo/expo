title: Building Standalone Apps
---

The purpose of this guide is to help you create standalone binaries of your Expo app for iOS and
Android which can be submitted to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

An Apple Developer account is needed to build an iOS standalone app, but a Google Play Developer
account is not needed to build the Android standalone app. If you'd like to submit to either app
store, you will need a developer account on that store.

It's a good idea to read the best practices about [Deploying to App Stores](app-stores.md) to
ensure your app is in good shape to get accepted into the Apple and Google marketplaces. We can
generate builds for you, but it's up to you to make your app awesome.

## 1. Install Expo CLI

Expo CLI is the tool for developing and building Expo apps. Run `npm install -g expo-cli` (or `yarn global add expo-cli`) to get it.

If you haven't created an Expo account before, you'll be asked to create one when running the build command.

**Windows users** must have WSL enabled. You can follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). We recommend picking Ubuntu from the Windows Store. Be sure
to launch Ubuntu at least once. After that, use an Admin powershell to run:
`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`

## 2. Configure app.json

```javascript
 {
   "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "icon": "./path/to/your/app-icon.png",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourappname",
      "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourappname",
      "versionCode": 1
    }
   }
 }
```

- The iOS `bundleIdentifier` and Android `package` fields use reverse DNS notation, but don't have to be related to a domain. Replace `"com.yourcompany.yourappname"` with whatever makes sense for your app.
- You're probably not surprised that `name`, `icon` and `version` are required.
- `slug` is the url name that your app's JavaScript is published to. For example: `expo.io/@community/native-component-list`, where `community` is my username and `native-component-list` is the slug.
- The `ios.buildNumber` and `android.versionCode` distinguish different binaries of your app. Make sure to increment these for each build you upload to the App Store or Google Play store.

There are other options you might want to add to `app.json`. We have only covered what is
required. For example, some people like to configure their own build number, linking scheme, and
more. We highly recommend you read through [Configuration with app.json / app.config.js](../workflow/configuration.md) for the
full spec. This is also your last chance to double check our [recommendations](app-stores.md)
for App Store metadata.

## 3. Start the build

Run `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`. If you don't already have a packager running for this project, `expo` will start one for you.

**Please note:** When you run `expo build`, Expo automatically publishes your app (with `expo publish`). In order to avoid accidentally publishing changes to your production app, you may want to use [release channels](release-channels.md).

### If you choose to build for Android

When building for android you can choose to build APK (`expo build:android -t apk`) or Android App Bundle (`expo build:android -t app-bundle`).
App bundles are recommended, but you have to make sure the [Google Play App Signing](app-signing.md) is enabled for your project,
you can read more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle).

The first time you build the project you will be asked whether you'd like to upload a keystore or
have us handle it for you. If you don't know what a keystore is, you can have us generate one for you. Otherwise,
feel free to upload your own.

If you choose to let Expo generate a keystore for you, we **strongly recommend** that you later run `expo fetch:android:keystore`
and backup your keystore to a safe location. Once you submit an app to the Google Play Store, all future updates to that app **must**
be signed with the same keystore to be accepted by Google. If, for any reason, you delete your project or clear your credentials
in the future, you will not be able to submit any updates to your app if you have not backed up your keystore.

```sh
[exp] No currently active or previous builds for this project.

Would you like to upload a keystore or have us generate one for you?
If you don't know what this means, let us handle it! :)

  1) Let Expo handle the process!
  2) I want to upload my own keystore!
```

> **Note:** If you choose the first option and later decide to upload your own keystore, we currently offer an option to clear your current Android keystore from our build servers by running `expo build:android --clear-credentials.` **This is irreversible, so only run this command if you know what you are doing!** You can download a backup copy of the keystore by running `expo fetch:android:keystore`. **If you do not have a local copy of your keystore , you will be unable to publish new versions of your app to the Play Store**. Your only option would be to generate a new keystore and re-upload your application as a new application. You can learn more about how code signing and keystores work [in the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html).

### If you choose to build for iOS

You can build standalone apps for iOS with two different types, an archive (`expo build:ios -t archive`) or simulator (`expo build:ios -t simulator`) build.
With the simulator build, you can test your standalone app on a simulator.
If you want to publish your app to the store or distribute it with tools like TestFlight, you have to use the archive.

When building for iOS, you are given a choice of letting Expo create the necessary credentials for you,
while still having a chance to provide your own overrides. Your Apple ID and password are used locally and are never saved on Expo's servers.

```sh
$ expo build:ios
[16:44:37] Checking if current build exists...

[16:44:37] No currently active or previous builds for this project.
[16:44:37]
We need your Apple ID/password to manage certificates, keys
and provisioning profiles from your Apple Developer account.

Note: Expo does not keep your Apple ID or your Apple ID password.

? What\'s your Apple ID? xxx@yyy.zzz
? Password? [hidden]
✔ Authenticated with Apple Developer Portal successfully!
[16:44:46] You have 4 teams associated with your account
? Which team would you like to use? 3) ABCDEFGHIJ "John Turtle" (Individual)
✔ Ensured App ID exists on Apple Developer Portal!
[16:44:59] We do not have some credentials for you: Apple Distribution Certificate, Apple Push Notifications service key, Apple Provisioning Profile
? How would you like to upload your credentials? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Expo handles all credentials, you can still provide overrides
  I will provide all the credentials and files needed, Expo does limited validation
```

Unless you're very familiar with iOS credentials already, it's best to let Expo handle the creation & management of all your credentials for you. If you'd like to know more about iOS credentials, we've written a guide with everything you need to know [here](app-signing.md).

If you plan on providing your own certificates, we recommend creating them in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list).

#### Enterprise distribution

The Expo build service supports both normal App Store distribution as well as enterprise distribution. To use the latter, you must be a member of the ["Apple Developer Enterprise Program"](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/). Only normal Apple developer accounts can build apps that can be submitted to the Apple App Store, and only enterprise developer accounts can build apps that can be distributed using enterprise distribution methods. When you call `expo build:ios`, you just need to choose the correct team, it will be labeled `(In-House)`.

#### Adhoc distribution

> Since this requires you to provide credential overrides, this feature should only be used if you're comfortable with iOS credentials.

It's usually easiest to test your standalone app on a simulator with the `expo build:ios -t simulator` command, and then use TestFlight for your physical device testing. But if you'd like an IPA that you can install directly onto your physical device through Xcode, you can generate one with Expo CLI:

- Run `expo build:ios` once to generate some preliminary certificates, namely your app identifier, and distribution certificate.
- Now, create a new provisioning profile [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list), and under `Distribution`, select `Adhoc`. Then provide your app identifier and the distribution certificate you created in the last step. **If you don't provide those exact certificates, your build will fail.**
- Download the provisioning profile, and then pass it to the build command like this: `expo build:ios --provisioning-profile-path ~/Path/To/provisioningProfileYouCreated.mobileprovision`, and make sure the rest of the certificates you use match those you selected when creating your adhoc provisioning profile in the previous step.

Once Expo finishes your build, you can install it onto your device via Xcode by opening the `Devices & Simulators` window, selecting your connected device, and under `Installed Apps`, click the `+` and then select the IPA Expo generated for you.

> **Note:** We enable bitcode for iOS, so the `.ipa` files for iOS are much larger than the eventual App Store download available to your users. For more information, see [App Thinning](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html).

### Switch to Push Notification Key on iOS

If you are using Push Notifications Certificate and want to switch to a Push Notifications Key you need
to start the build with `--clear-push-cert`. We will remove the legacy certificate from our servers and generate a Push Notifications Key for you.

## 4. Wait for it to finish building

When one of our building machines is free, it'll start building your app. You can check how long you'll wait on the [Turtle status](https://expo.io/turtle-status) site. We'll print a url you can visit (such as `expo.io/builds/some-unique-id`) to watch your build progress and access the build logs. Alternatively, you can check up on it by running `expo build:status`. When it's done, you'll see the url to your app file - an `.apk`, `.aab` (both Android), or `.ipa` (iOS) file. Copy and paste the link into your browser to download the file.

> Want to be notified programmatically as soon as your build is done? [Here's how you can set that up with webhooks](webhooks.md).

## 5. Test it on your device or simulator

### Android

- **To run it on your Android emulator**, first build your project with the apk flag by running `expo build:android -t apk`, and you can drag and drop the `.apk` into the emulator.
- **To run it on your Android device**, make sure you have the Android platform tools installed along with `adb`, then just run `adb install app-filename.apk` with [USB debugging enabled on your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#device-developer-options) and the device plugged in.

### iOS

- **To run it on your iOS simulator**, first build your project with the simulator flag by running `expo build:ios -t simulator`, then download the artifact with the link printed when your build completes. To install the resulting `tar.gz` file, unzip it and drag-and-drop it into your iOS simulator. If you'd like to install it from the command line, run `tar -xvzf your-app.tar.gz` to unpack the file, open a simulator, then run `xcrun simctl install booted <path to .app>`.

- **To test a device build with Apple TestFlight**, download the `.ipa` file to your local machine. Within [AppStoreConnect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps), click the plus icon and create a New App. Make sure your `bundleIdentifier` matches what you've placed in `app.json`. Now, you need to use Xcode or [Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784) (previously known as Application Loader) to upload the `.ipa` you got from `expo build:ios`. Once you do that, you can check the status of your build under `Activity`. Processing an app can take 10-15 minutes before it shows up under available builds.

## 6. Submit it to the appropriate store

Read the guide on [Uploading Apps to the Apple App Store and Google Play](uploading-apps.md).

## 7. Update your app

For the most part, when you want to update your app, just Publish again from Expo CLI. Your users will download the new JS the next time they open the app. To ensure your users have a seamless experience downloading JS updates, you may want to enable [background JS downloads](../guides/offline-support.md). However, there are a couple reasons why you might want to rebuild and resubmit the native binaries:

- If you want to change native metadata like the app's name or icon
- If you upgrade to a newer SDK version of your app (which requires new native code)

To keep track of this, you'll need to update your app's `versionCode` and `buildNumber` in app.json (see [here](../distribution/app-stores.md#versioning-your-app) for details).

It is a good idea to glance through the [app.json documentation](../workflow/configuration.md) to get an idea of all the properties you can change, e.g. the icons, deep linking url scheme, handset/tablet support, and a lot more.
