description: An overview of transferring the ownership of an app to a different entity.

import { BoxLink } from '~/ui/components/BoxLink';

There are two different representations of your app to consider when handing over ownership to another entity: the app as it exists on Expo Application Services (to create builds with EAS Build, send updates with EAS Update, and so on) and the app records on the app stores (to distribute the app to end-users). The following guides explain how to handle app transfers in each case.
