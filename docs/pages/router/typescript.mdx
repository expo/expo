> This guide requires expo@49.0.0-alpha.3 or greater––everything listed here is still experimental.

Expo Router provides an integrated TypeScript experience. To get started install TypeScript either by `yarn -D typescript` or `npm i -D typescript` and create a file with either a `ts` or `tsx` extension. Next time you run `expo start` your project will automatically be configured to support TypeScript.

## Statically Typed Links

Expo Router will generate a link definition in `.expo/types` that contains information about existing routes in your application. This overrides Expo Router's generic `Href<T>` definition with a personalised declaration.

Components and functions that use `Href<T>` will now by statically typed and have a much stricter definition. For example:

```tsx
✅ <Link href="/about" />
✅ <Link href="/user/1" />
✅ <Link href={`/user/${id}`} />
✅ <Link href={('/user' + id) as Href} />

// TypeScript errors if href is not a valid route
❌ <Link href="/usser/1" />
```

For dynamic routes, Href's need to be objects and their parameters are strictly typed

```tsx
✅ <Link href={{ pathname: "/user/[id]", params: { id: 1 }}} />


// TypeScript errors as href is valid, but it should be a HrefObject with params
❌ <Link href="/user/[id]" />
// TypeScript errors as params contains invalid keys
❌ <Link href={{ pathname: "/user/[id]", params: { _id: 1 }}} />
// TypeScript errors as params contains unknown keys
❌ <Link href={{ pathname: "/user/[id]", params: { id: 1, id2: 2 }}} />
```

## Changes made to environment

The `includes` field of your `tsconfig.json` will be updated to include `expo-env.d.ts` and a hidden `.expo` folder. These entries are required and should not be removed.

The generated `expo-env.d.ts` should not be removed or changed at any time. It should not be committed and should be ignored by version control (e.g. inside your .gitignore file).

### Global Types

Expo Router makes the following changes to your TypeScript environment.

- Sets `process.env.NODE_ENV = "development" | "production" | "test"`
- Allows the importing of `.[css|sass|scss]` files
- Sets the exports of `*.module.[css|sass|scss]` to be `Record<string, string`
- Add types for Metro's `require.context`

### React Native Web

Expo Router adds additional types for React Native Web. These include:

- Add additional web-only styles for `ViewStyle`/`TextStyle`/`ImageStyle`
- Add `tabIndex`/`accessibilityLevel`/`lang` to `TextProps`
- Add `hovered` to Pressable's `children` and `style` state callback function
- Add `className` elements
