There are three major elements that you can use to customize the appearance of your app:

- Fonts
- Images
- Splash screen

## Fonts

> In Expo Router v3 and greater, you can import SplashScreen from `expo-splash-screen` directly.

Expo Router extends the `expo-splash-screen` API to prevent white flash. Use it in conjunction with `expo-font` to keep the splash screen visible while fonts are loading:

```js app/_layout.js
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  /* @info Import `SplashScreen` from `expo-router` instead of `expo-splash-screen` */
  SplashScreen,
  /* @end */
  // This example uses a basic Layout component, but you can use any Layout.
  Slot,
} from 'expo-router';
import { useFonts, Inter_500Medium } from '@expo-google-fonts/inter';

/* @info Prevent hiding the splash screen after the navigation has mounted. */
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
/* @end */

export default function Layout() {
  /* @info Load the font <b>Inter_500Medium</b> */
  const [fontsLoaded, fontError] = useFonts({
    /* @end */
    Inter_500Medium,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (fontsLoaded || fontError) {
      // Hide the splash screen after the fonts have loaded (or an error was returned) and the UI is ready.
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [fontsLoaded, fontError]);

  // Prevent rendering until the font has loaded or an error was returned
  if (!fontsLoaded && !fontError) {
    return null;
  }

  // Render the children routes now that all the assets are loaded.
  return <Slot />;
}
```

In SDK 50 and above, Expo Router's [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering) provides [automatic static optimization](/router/reference/static-rendering#fonts) for font loading on web. This enables best-practices for working with fonts in the browser.

## Images

We recommend you use Expo Image for the best cross-platform experience:

  description="For more information on how to install and use expo-image, see its API documentation."
  href="/versions/latest/sdk/image"
  imageUrl="/static/images/packages/expo-image.png"
/>

## Splash screen

Splash screens are required on native platforms. Expo Router automatically orchestrates the native splash screen to keep it visible until the first route is rendered, this applies to any route that the user deep links into. To enable this functionality, install expo-splash-screen in your project.

The default behavior is to hide the splash screen when the first route is rendered, this is optimal for the majority of routes. For some routes, you may want to prolong the splash screen until additional data or asset loading has concluded. This can be achieved with the `SplashScreen` module from `expo-router`. If `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync` is called before the splash screen is hidden, then the splash screen will remain visible until the `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` function has been invoked.

```js app/index.tsx
import { SplashScreen } from 'expo-router';

/* @info Prevent hiding the splash screen after the navigation has mounted. */
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
/* @end */

export default function App() {
  const [isReady, setReady] = React.useState(false);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Perform some sort of async data or asset fetching.
    setTimeout(() => {
      // When all loading is setup, unmount the splash screen component.
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
      setReady(true);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return <Text>My App</Text>;
}
```

## React Navigation themes

React Navigation navigators `<Stack>`, `<Drawer>`, and `<Tabs>` use a shared appearance provider. In React Navigation, you set the theme for the entire app using the `<NavigationContainer />` component. Expo Router manages the root container so that you can set the theme using the `ThemeProvider` directly.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
/* @info Import theme APIs from React Navigation directly. */
import { ThemeProvider, DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, useTheme } from '@react-navigation/native';
/* @end */
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    /* @info All layouts inside this provider will use the dark theme. */
    <ThemeProvider value={DarkTheme}>
      /* @end */
      <Slot />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

You can use this technique at any layer of the app to set the theme for a specific layout. The current theme can be accessed with `useTheme` from `@react-navigation/native`.

## React Navigation Elements

The [`@react-navigation/elements`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/elements/) library provides a set of UI elements and helpers that can be used to build a navigation UI. These components are designed to be composable and customizable. You can reuse the default functionality from the library or build your navigator's UI on top of it.

To use it with Expo Router, you need to install the library:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="npm">

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install @react-navigation/elements']} />

</Tab>

<Tab label="Yarn">

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn add @react-navigation/elements']} />

</Tab>

</Tabs>

To learn more about the components and utilities the library provides, see [Elements library](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/elements/) documentation.
