There are two ways you can get started to install and use Expo Router in your app.

## Quick start

<Step label="1">

We recommend creating a new Expo app using `create-expo-app`. This will create a minimal project with the smallest footprint to get you started. To create a project, run the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app@latest --example with-router']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Once setup, you can start your project with any of these commands:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

To view your app on a mobile device, we recommend starting with [Expo Go](/get-started/expo-go). As your application grows in complexity and you need more control, you can create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

</Step>

## Manual Setup

> Expo Router supports Expo SDK 48 and above. Some features may require the latest SDK.

### Prerequisites

Make sure your computer is [set up for running an Expo app](/get-started/installation/).

<Step label="1">

### Create an Expo project

To create a new project, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app']} />

</Step>

<Step label="2">

### Install dependencies

You'll need to install the following dependencies:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '$ npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar react-native-gesture-handler',
  ]}
/>

The above command will install versions of these libraries that are compatible with the Expo SDK version your project is using.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

### Setup entry point

Either delete the entry point in your **package.json** or replace it with **index.js** to be explicit:

```json package.json
{
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

Create a new file **index.js** in the root of your project. If it exists already, replace it with the following:

```js index.js
import 'expo-router/entry';
```

</Step>

<Step label="4">

### Modify project configuration

Add a deep linking `scheme` and enable [Metro web](/guides/customizing-metro/#web-support-how) in your app config (**app.json** or **app.config.js**):

```diff
{
  "expo": {
+   "scheme": "myapp",
+   "web": {
+     "bundler": "metro"
+   }
  }
}
```

</Step>

## For Expo SDK below 49

Expo Router requires at least `metro@0.76.0`. If you are using Expo SDK version below 49, you will need to force upgrade your `metro` version by setting a Yarn resolution or npm override.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Yarn">

    ```json package.json
    {
      "resolutions": {
        "metro": "0.76.0",
        "metro-resolver": "0.76.0"
      }
    }
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab label="npm">
    ```json package.json
    {
      "overrides": {
        "metro": "0.76.0",
        "metro-resolver": "0.76.0"
      }
    }
    ```
</Tab>
