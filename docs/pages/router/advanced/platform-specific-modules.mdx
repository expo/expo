import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

While building your app, you may want to show specific content based on the current platform. Platform-specific extensions and `Platform` module can make the experience more native to a given platform. The following sections describe the ways you can achieve this with Expo Router.

## Platform-specific extensions

> **warning** Platform-specific extensions were added in Expo Router `3.5.x`. If you are using an older version of the library, follow instructions from [Platform-specific modules](#platform-module).

Metro bundler's platform-specific extensions (for example, **.ios.tsx** or **.native.tsx**) are supported in the **app** directory only if a **non-platform version** also exists. This ensures that routes are universal across platforms for deep linking.

Consider the following project structure:

<FileTree
  files={[
    'app/_layout.tsx',
    'app/_layout.web.tsx',
    'app/index.tsx',
    'app/about.tsx',
    'app/about.web.tsx',
  ]}
/>

In the above file structure:

- **\_layout.web.tsx** file is used as a layout on the web and **\_layout.tsx** is used on all other platforms.
- **index.tsx** file is used as the home page for all platforms.
- **about.web.tsx** file is used as the about page for the web, and the **about.tsx** file is used on all other platforms.

> **info** **Note:** Providing a route file without a platform-specific extension is required to ensure every platform has a default implementation.

## Platform module

You can use the [`Platform`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-module) module from React Native to detect the current platform and render the appropriate content based on the result. For example, you can render a `Tabs` layout on native and a custom layout on the web.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import { Link, Slot, Tabs } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
    // Use a basic custom layout on web.
    return (
      <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <header>
          <Link href="/">Home</Link>
          <Link href="/settings">Settings</Link>
        </header>
        <Slot />
      </div>
    );
  }
  // Use a native bottom tabs layout on native platforms.
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Home' }} />
      <Tabs.Screen name="settings" options={{ title: 'Settings' }} />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```
