> **warning** Static redirects were added Expo Router `4.x.x`.

## Redirect component

To use <Redirect />, simply import it from expo-router and specify the href prop with the desired destination route.

```tsx
import { Redirect } from 'expo-router';

export default function Index() {
  return <Redirect href="/home" />;
}
```

In this example, when the user visits this page, they will be automatically redirected to /home.

```tsx
You can use <Redirect /> within a component that checks for conditions before navigating.

import { Redirect } from 'expo-router';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  // Simulate checking authentication status
  setTimeout(() => setIsAuthenticated(true), 2000);
}, []);

if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return <Redirect href="/login" />;
}

  return <Text>Welcome to the protected page!</Text>;
}
```

In this case, if the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the /login page.

## Static redirects

Static redirects allow you to specify a redirect configuration in your **app.json**. This allows you to specify redirects for routes that may no longer exist in your **app** directory. When you navigate to a screen, Expo Router simulates a `GET` request to a local server which responds with the screens contents. This ensures that Expo Router behaves consistently on native, web and when fetching React Server Components. As such, this configuration is based upon **server requests** and is based upon the request URL, not the screen name.

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      "redirects": [{
        "source": "/redirect/from/here",
        "destination: "/to/this/route"
      }]
    ]
  ]
}
```

Each redirect configuration should have the following properties:

- **source** is the incoming request path pattern.
- **destination** is the path you want to route to.

And can have these optional properties:

- **permanent** true or false - if true will use the 308 status code which instructs clients/search engines to cache the redirect forever, if false will use the 307 status code which is temporary and is not cached.

Unlike routes within the **app** directory, you do not need to add the `/index` suffix for a directory route or `+api` to for API routes.

You cannot create redirects for `_layout` files.

### Dynamic routes

The `source` and `destination` routes can use the [dynamic route syntax](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/dynamic-routes/) create redirects for dynamic routes

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      "redirects": [{
        "source": "/redirect/[slug]",
        "destination: "/target/[slug]"
      }]
    ]
  ]
}
```

When performing the redirection the variable names will be matched if able. Any unmatched variables will be provided on query params.

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      "redirects": [{
        "source": "/redirect/[fruit]/[vegetable]/[meat]",
        "destination: "/target/[vegetable]/[fruit]"
      }]
    ]
  ]
}
```

Using the configuration above, `/redirect/apple/carrot/beef` will redirect to `/target/carrot/apple?meat=beef`

### HTTP methods

To redirect only certain HTTP methods, provide the methods as a string array. Remember that screens are considered a `GET` request

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      "redirects": [{
        "source": "/redirect/[slug]",
        "destination: "/target/[slug]"
        "methods": ["POST"]
      }]
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Rewrites

Rewrites are only possible by the static configuration. Rewrites are different from redirects as they act as a URL proxy and hide the destination URL. While redirects will return back a HTTP status code and reroute the request, a rewrite will simply render the new destination without changing the URL.

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      "rewrites": [{
        "source": "/redirect/from/here",
        "destination: "/to/this/route"
      }]
    ]
  ]
}
```
