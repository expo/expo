## Expo Router notation

When you look inside the **app** directory in a typical Expo Router project, you'll see a lot more than some simple file and directory names. What do the parentheses and brackets mean? Let's learn the significance of file-based routing notation and how it allows you to define complex navigation patterns.

### Simple names/no notation

<FileTree files={[['app/home.tsx'], ['app/feed/favorites.tsx']]} />

Regular folder and file names without any notation signify _static routes_. Their URL matches exactly as they appear in your file tree. So, a file named **favorites.tsx** inside the **feed** folder will have a URL of `/feed/favorites`.

### Square brackets

<FileTree files={[['app/[userName].tsx'], ['app/products/[productId]/index.tsx']]} />

If you see square brackets in a file or directory name, you are looking at a _dynamic route_. The name of the route includes a parameter that can be used when rendering the page. The parameter could be either in a folder name or a file name. For example, a file named **[userName].tsx** will match `/evanbacon`, `/expo`, or another username. Then, you can access that parameter with the `useLocalSearchParams` hook inside the page, using that to load the data for that specific user.

### Parentheses

<FileTree files={[['app/(tabs)/index.tsx'], ['app/(tabs)/settings.tsx']]} />

A folder with its name surrounded in parenthesis indicates a _route group_. These folders are useful for grouping routes together without affecting the URL. For example, a file named **(tabs)/settings.tsx** will have `/settings` for its URL, even though it is not directly in the **app** directory.

Route groups could be useful for simple organization purposes, but often becomes more important for defining complex relationships between routes.

### index.tsx files

<FileTree files={[['app/(tabs)/index.tsx'], ['app/profile/index.tsx']]} />

Just like on the web, an **index.tsx** file indicates the default route for a folder. For example, a file named **profile/index.tsx** will match `/profile`. A file named **(tabs)/index.tsx** will match `/`, effectively becoming the default route for your entire app.

### \_layout.tsx files

<FileTree files={[['app/\_layout.tsx'], ['app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx'], ['app/feed/\_layout.tsx']]} />

**\_layout.tsx** files are special files that are not pages themselves, but define how groups of routes inside a folder relate to each other. If a folder of routes are arranged as a stack or tabs, the layout route is where you would define that relationship by using a stack navigator or tab navigator component.

Layout routes are rendered prior to the actual page routes inside their folder. This means that the **\_layout.tsx** directly inside the app folder is rendered before anything else in the app, and is where you would put initialization code that may have previously gone inside an **App.js** file.

### Plus sign

<FileTree files={[['app/+not-found.tsx'], ['app/+native-intent.tsx']]} />

Routes starting with a “+” have special significance to Expo Router. One example is `+not-found`, which is a catches any requests that don't match a route in your app. You’ll learn more about these as you need them.

## Route notation applied

Consider the following project file structure to identify the different types of routes represented:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/index.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/feed.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/\profile.tsx'],
    ['app/_layout.tsx'],
    ['app/users/[userId].tsx'],
    ['app/users/+not-found.tsx'],
    ['app/about.tsx'],
  ]}
/>

- **app/about.tsx** is a static route that matches `/about`.
- **app/users/[userId].tsx** is a dynamic route that matches `/users/123`, `/users/456`, and so on.
- **app/(tabs)** is a route group. It will not factor into the URL, so `/feed` will match **app/(tabs)/feed.tsx**.
- **app/(tabs)\index.tsx** is the default route for the **(tabs)** folder, so it will be the initially-focusd tab, and will match the `/` URL.
- **app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx** is a layout file defining how the three pages inside **app/(tabs)** relate to each other. If we use a tab navigator component inside of this file, then those screens will be arranged as tabs.
- **app/\_layout.tsx** is the root layout file, and is rendered before any other route in the app.
- **+not-found.tsx** is a special route that will be displayed if the user navigates to a route that doesn't exist in your app.
