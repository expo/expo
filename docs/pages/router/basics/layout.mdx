Each directory within the **app** directory (including **app** itself) can define a layout in the form of a **\_layout.tsx** file inside that directory. This file defines how all the pages within that directory are arranged. This is where you would define a stack navigator, tab navigator, drawer navigator, or any other layout that you want to use for the pages in that directory. The layout file exports a default component that is rendered before whatever page you are navigating to within that directory.

Let's look at a few common layout scenarios.

## Root layout

Virtually every app will have a **\_layout.tsx** file directly inside the **app** directory. This is the root layout and represents the entry point for your navigation. In addition to describing the top-level navigator for your app, this file is where you would put initialization code that may have previously gone inside an **App.jsx** file, such as loading fonts, interacting with the splash screen, or adding context providers.

Here's an example root layout:

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function RootLayout() {
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    SpaceMono: require('../assets/fonts/SpaceMono-Regular.ttf'),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded) {
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [loaded]);

  if (!loaded) {
    return null;
  }

  return <Stack />;
}
```

The above example shows the splash screen initially and then renders a stack navigator once the fonts are loaded, which will cause your app to proceed to the initial route.

## Stacks

You can implement a stack navigator in your root layout, as shown above, or in any other layout file inside a directory. Let's suppose you have a file structure with a stack inside of a directory:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/products/\_layout.tsx'],
    ['app/products/index.tsx'],
    ['app/products/[productId].tsx'],
    ['app/products/accessories/index.tsx'],
  ]}
/>

If you want everything inside of the **app/products** directory to be arranged in a stack relationship, inside the **\_layout.tsx** file, return a `Stack` component:

```tsx app/products/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function StackLayout() {
  return <Stack />;
}
```

When you navigate to `/products`, it will first go to the default route, which is **products/index.tsx**. If you navigate to `/products/123`, then that page will be pushed onto the stack. By default, the stack will render a back button in the header that will pop the current page off the stack, returning the user to the previous page. Even when a page isn't visible, if it is still pushed onto the stack, it is still being rendered.

The `Stack` component implements [React Navigation's native stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/) and can use the same screen options. However, you do not have to define the pages specifically inside the navigator. The files inside the directory will be automatically treated as eligible routes in the stack. However, if you want to define screen options, you can add a `Stack.Screen` component inside the `Stack` component. The `name` prop should match the route name, but you do not need to supply a `component` prop; Expo Router will map this automatically:

```tsx app/products/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function StackLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="[productId]" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

While it is possible to nest navigators, be sure to only do so when it is truly needed. In the above example, if you want to push **products/accessories/index.tsx** onto the stack, it's not necessary to have an additional **\_layout.tsx** in the **accessories** directory with a `Stack` navigator. That would define another stack inside the first one. It is fine to add directories that only affect the URL, otherwise, use the same navigator as the parent directory.

## Tabs

Much like a stack, you can implement a tab navigator in your layout file, and all the routes directly inside that directory will be treated as tabs. Consider the following file structure:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/index.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/feed.tsx'],
    ['app/(tabs)/profile.tsx'],
  ]}
/>

In the **\_layout.tsx** file, return a `Tabs` component:

```tsx app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router';
import MaterialIcons from '@expo/vector-icons/MaterialIcons';

export default function TabLayout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          title: 'Home',
          tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <MaterialIcons size={28} name="house.fill" color={color} />,
        }}
      />
      <!-- Add more tabs here -->
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

This will cause the **index.tsx**, **feed.tsx**, and **profile.tsx** files to appear together in the same bottom tabs navigator. This `Tabs` component uses [React Navigation's native bottom tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/) and supports the same options.

In the case of `Tabs`, you will likely want to define the tabs in the navigator, as this influences the order in which tabs appear, the title, and the icon inside the tab. The index route will be the default selected tab.

## Slot

In some cases, you may want a layout without a navigator. This is helpful for adding a header or footer around the current route, or for displaying a modal over any route inside a directory. In this case, you can use the `Slot` component, which serves as a placeholder for the current child route.

Consider the following file structure:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/social/\_layout.tsx'],
    ['app/social/index.tsx'],
    ['app/social/feed.tsx'],
    ['app/social/profile.tsx'],
  ]}
/>

For example, you may want to wrap any route inside the **social** directory with a header and footer, but you want navigating between the pages to simply replace the current page rather than pushing new pages onto a stack, which can then later be popped off with a "back" navigation action. In the **\_layout.tsx** file, return a `Slot` component surrounded by your header and footer:

```tsx app/social/_layout.tsx
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Slot />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Other layouts

These are just a few examples of common layouts to give you an idea of how it works. There's much more you can do with layout:

- Implement a [Drawer navigator](/router/advanced/drawer)
- Replace the default tabs with [fully customized tabs](/router/advanced/custom-tabs)
- Use a [modal](/router/advanced/modals) to display a page with transparency, such that the parent navigator is still visible underneath
- [Adapt any navigator that is compatible with React Navigation](/versions/latest/sdk/router/#withlayoutcontextnav-processor), including top tabs, bottom sheets, and more
