Expo Router offers a set of components to create custom Tabs layouts. Unlike the React Navigation styled `<Tabs />`, these components are un-styled and un-opinionated. They are designed for you to build a complex UI from scratch.

## Anatomy

- **Tabs**: The containing `<View />` for the tabs
- **TabList**: The containing `<View />` for the the list of tab triggers
- **TabTrigger>**: A trigger to switch to the specified tab
- **TabSlot**: A slot to render the current tab

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabSlot />
  <TabList>
    <TabTrigger name="home" href="/">
      <Text>Home</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
    <TabTrigger name="article" href="/article">
      <Text>article</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
  </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

## Creating routes

The `<TabList />` component is the "holding" component for routes. `<TabTrigger />`'s defined as a child of the `<TabList />` specific what routes are present as a tab. A `<TabTrigger />` within a `<TabList />` must include a `name` and a `href` prop. `<TabList />` needs to be an immediate child of `<Tabs />`

`<TabList />` is both the configuration and default appearance of the `<Tabs />`. Triggers present within the `<TabList />` dictate what routes are possible within the `<Tabs />`

> `name` can be any `string`. This is a user-defined name for the Tab.

### Dynamic routes

Dynamic routes are allowed and can be provided with values via the `href`

<FileTree files={['_layout.tsx', ['[slug].tsx']]} />

The trigger `<Trigger name="dynamic page" href="/hello-world" />` will create a tab for `[slug].tsx` with the params `{ slug: 'hello-world' }`

### Ambagious routes

<FileTree files={['_layout.tsx', ['(one,two)/route.tsx', 'A route within a shared group']]} />

The `href` values provided to `<TabTrigger />` cannot be ambagious and must always point to a single route. The href `/route` is not allowed, as it could refer to either `/(one)/route` or `/(two)/route`.

### Nested routes

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['_layout.tsx'],
    ['(stack-one)/_layout.tsx', 'A <Stack> layout'],
    ['(stack-one)/(stack-two)/_layout.tsx', 'Nested <Stack> layout'],
    '(stack-one)/(stack-two)/route.tsx',
  ]}
/>

A `<TabTrigger />` can link to a deeply nested route. `<TabTrigger name="route" href="/route" />` will show the `(stack-one)/(stack-two)/route.tsx` route. This tab will be controlled by that routes parent navigators (the two `<Stack>`). This navigation is similar to a deep link.

## Rendering routes

The `<TabSlot />` component renders the current route. `<TabSlot />` be can be nested inside other components but cannot be within the `<TabList />`

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <TabTrigger name="home" href="/">
      <Text>Home</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
  </TabList>
  {/* customize how `<TabSlot />` is rendered */}
  /* @info TabSlot be nested inside custom components */
  <View>
    <View>
      <TabSlot />
    </View>
  </View>
  /* @end */
</Tabs>
```

## Switching tabs

Tabs can be switched via a `<Link />` or using the imperative APIs, however these APIs will always perform a navigation action (they will switch tabs and might change the URL). To switch tabs without performing any navigation, you should a `<TabTrigger />`. A `<TabTrigger />` is an unstyled `<View />` that will switch tabs when pressed.

### Resetting navigation

The `<TabTrigger />` `reset` prop can be used to control when a tab resets its navigation state. The options are `always`, `onLongPress` and `never`

## `<TabTrigger />`

The `<TabTrigger />` is used to switch tabs, but also have a the dual role of defining what routes are available as a tab.

### Within `<TabList />`

When a `<TabTrigger />` is used as a child of `<TabList />` defines what routes have tabs. These `<TabTrigger />` need to include both the `name` and `href` props as they define the URL for that tab and a custom name that can be used to refer to the tab.

### Outside `<TabList />`

A `<TabTrigger />` elsewhere in your application does not need the `href` prop. Instead it just requires a `name` which matches one of the names present on a `<TabTrigger />` within the `<TabList />`. This allows you to create components that can switch tabs and be agnostic to your current navigation state.

## Customizing appearance

All components are rendered unstyled as a `<View />`, except `<TabTrigger />` which renders as a `<Pressable />`. This allows you to provide a custom `style` prop to customize their appearance.

If you need to change the structure of a component, you can override its underlying component by using the `asChild` props. The component then acts as a slot, and will forward its props to its immediate child.

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabSlot />
  /* @info Change the appearance of the <TabList /> */
  <TabList asChild>
    {/* Render a custom TabList */}
    <CustomTabList>
      <TabTrigger name="home" href="/">
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </TabTrigger>
    </CustomTabList>
  </TabList>
  /* @end */
</Tabs>
```

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabSlot />
  <TabList asChild>
    /* @info Change the appearance of the <TabTrigger /> */
    <TabTrigger name="home" href="/" asChild>
      {/* Render a custom button */}
      <CustomButton>
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </CustomButton>
    </TabTrigger>
    /* @end */
  </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

### Multiple tab bars

The `<TabList />` is both the configuration and default appearance of the `<Tabs />`, but its not the only way to render a tab bar. By hiding the `<TabList />`, you can construct custom tab bars using `<TabTrigger />`

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <TabSlot />
  {/* A custom tab bar */}
  <View>
    /* @info A custom tab bar. TabTrigger's outside of TabList do not need the `href` prop */
    <View>
      <TabTrigger name="home">
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </TabTrigger>
      <TabTrigger name="article">
        <Text>article</Text>
      </TabTrigger>
    </View>
    /* @end */
  </View>
  /* @info TabList needs to be rendered, but not necessary displayed */
  <TabList style={{ display: 'none' }}>
    /* @end */
    <TabTrigger name="home" href="/">
      <Text>Home</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
    <TabTrigger name="article" href="/article">
      <Text>article</Text>
    </TabTrigger>
  </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

### Hooks

All components also have a hook version and allows to you create the same functionality without the restrictions of using components. Using hooks, you have complete control over the render tree. The [Router UI Reference](/versions/unversioned/router-ui) for a full list of the hooks available.

### Screen renderer

The `<TabSlot />` accepts an `options` prop with `renderFn` property. This function can be used to override how your screen is rendered, allowing you to implement advanced functionality such as animations or persisting/unmounting screens. See the [Router UI Reference](/versions/unversioned/router-ui) for more information.

## FAQs

### How do I create multiple tabs for the same route?

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['_layout.tsx', 'Tabs layout'],
    ['(movie,tv)/[id].tsx', ''],
  ]}
/>

You should add the route to a shared group and create a separate `<TabTrigger />` for each group `group`.

### How do I hide a tab?

Not rendering the `<TabTrigger />` will remove that tab (and its navigation state) from your app.

### How do I create animated tabs?

You can provide a custom renderer to `<TabSlot />` to customize how it renders a screen. You can use this to detect when screen is focused an animate appropriately.

### Can I use relative hrefs?

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['directory/_layout.tsx', 'The local pathname is /directory'],
    ['directory/page.tsx', 'The pathname is /directory/page'],
    ['directory/profile.tsx', 'The pathname is /directory/page'],
  ]}
/>

A `<TabTrigger />` with a relative href are relative to the local pathname `<Tabs />` was rendered
on. This is different to normal relative hrefs which are relative to the current displayed route. For example, the `<TabTrigger href="./profile" />` will resolve to `/directory/profile`, even when the `/directory/page` route is showing. Expo recommends against using relative hrefs.
