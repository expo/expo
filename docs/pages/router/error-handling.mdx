This guide specifies how to handle unmatched routes and errors in your app when using Expo Router.

## Unmatched routes

Native apps don't have a server so there are technically no 404s. However, if you're implementing a router universally, then it makes sense to handle missing routes. This is done automatically for each app, but you can also customize it.

```js app/+not-found.js
import { Unmatched } from 'expo-router';
export default Unmatched;
```

This will render the default `Unmatched`. You can export any component you want to render instead. We recommend having a link to `/` so users can navigate back to the home screen.

## Error handling

Expo Router enables fine-tuned error handling to enable a more opinionated data-loading strategy in the future.

You can export a nested `ErrorBoundary` component from any route to intercept and format component-level errors using [React Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary):

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx app/home.tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

/* @info */
export function ErrorBoundary(props: ErrorBoundaryProps) {
/* @end */
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "red" }}>
      <Text>{props.error.message}</Text>
      <Text onPress={props.retry}>Try Again?</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default function Page() { ... }
```

When you export an `ErrorBoundary` the route will be wrapped with a React Error Boundary effectively:

```jsx Virtual
function Route({ ErrorBoundary, Component }) {
  return (
    <Try catch={ErrorBoundary}>
      <Component />
    </Try>
  );
}
```

When `ErrorBoundary` is not present, the error will be thrown to the nearest parent's `ErrorBoundary`.

## API

<APIBox header="ErrorBoundaryProps">

Each `ErrorBoundary` is passed the following props:

- **error:** `Error` &mdash; The error that was thrown.
- **retry:** `() => Promise<void>` &mdash; A function that will rerender the route component.

</APIBox>

<APIBox header="ErrorBoundary">

You can also use the default `ErrorBoundary` component for a quick UI:

```js app/home.tsx
// Re-export the default UI
export { ErrorBoundary } from 'expo-router';
```

</APIBox>

### Work in progress

React Native LogBox needs to be presented less aggressively to develop with errors. Currently, it shows for `console.error` and `console.warn`. However, it should ideally only show for uncaught errors.
