import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

Unlike React Navigation, Expo Router always has access to a URL. This means screen tracking is as easy as the web.

1. Create a higher-order component that observes the currently selected URL
2. Track the URL in your analytics provider

<FileTree files={['app/_layout.tsx']} />

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { usePathname, useGlobalSearchParams, Slot } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const params = useGlobalSearchParams();

  // Track the location in your analytics provider here.
  useEffect(() => {
    analytics.track({ pathname, params });
  }, [pathname, params]);

  // Export all the children routes in the most basic way.
  return <Slot />;
}
```

Now when the user changes routes, the analytics provider will be notified.

## Migrating from React Navigation

React Navigation's [screen tracking guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen-tracking/) cannot make the same assumptions about the navigation state that Expo Router can. As a result, the implementation requires the use of `onReady` and `onStateChange` callbacks. Avoid using these methods if possible as the root `<NavigationContainer />` is not directly exposed and allows cascading in Expo Router.
