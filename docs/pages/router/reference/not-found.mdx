description: Learn how to handle server 404s and missing routes.

> Available from Expo SDK 50 and Expo Router v3.

404s can be handled by using a **+not-found.js** route. This route matches all unmatched routes from a nested level. This is similar to **[...wild].tsx**. However, unlike the deep dynamic routes, **+not-found.js** is matched after API routes.

On web, the server will first serve files in the following order:

1. Static files in the **public** directory.
2. Standard and dynamic routes in the app directory.
3. API routes in the app directory.
4. Not found routes will be served last with a 404 status code.

On native, where there is no server, the router will first try to perform a client-navigation, then fall back on `+not-found` routes if no route matches.

In the future, `+not-found` routes will integrate with data fetching and suspense to allow for custom 404 pages during online-only native operations.
