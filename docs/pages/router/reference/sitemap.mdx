On native, you can use the [`uri-scheme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme) CLI to test opening native links on a device.

For example, if you want to launch the Expo Go app on iOS to the `/form-sheet` route, run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx uri-scheme open exp://192.168.87.39:19000/--/form-sheet --ios']} />

> Replace `192.168.87.39:19000` with the IP address shown when running `npx expo start`.

You can also search for links directly in a browser like Safari or Chrome to test deep linking on physical devices. Learn more about [testing deep links](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking).

## Sitemap

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Directory structure"
  src="/static/images/expo-router/directory.png"
  className="max-w-[720px]"
/>

Expo Router currently injects a **/\_sitemap** automatically that provides a list of all routes in the app. This is useful for debugging.

In SDK 52+, the sitemap can be removed by adding `sitemap: false` to your `app.json`

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      {
        /* @info Disable the sitemap generation. */
        "sitemap": false
        /* @end */
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

In SDK <52, the sitemap can be removed by creating an empty `_sitemap` file.

```tsx app/_sitemap.tsx
export default function Sitemap() {
  return null;
}
```
