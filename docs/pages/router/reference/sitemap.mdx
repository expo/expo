On native, you can use the [`uri-scheme`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme) CLI to test opening native links on a device.

For example, if you want to launch the Expo Go app on iOS to the `/form-sheet` route, run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx uri-scheme open exp://192.168.87.39:19000/--/form-sheet --ios']} />

> Replace `192.168.87.39:19000` with the IP address shown when running `npx expo start`.

You can also search for links directly in a browser like Safari or Chrome to test deep linking on physical devices. Learn more about [testing deep links](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking).

## Sitemap

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Directory structure"
  src="/static/images/expo-router-advance/directory.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

Expo Router currently injects a **/\_sitemap** which provides a list of all routes in the app. This is especially useful for debugging.

This can be removed by adding a **app/\_sitemap.js** file and returning a null component:

```jsx app/_sitemap.js
export default function Sitemap() {
  return null;
}
```
