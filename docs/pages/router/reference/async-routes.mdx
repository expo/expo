> This guide requires `expo@49.0.0-alpha.3` or higher and `metro@0.76.3` &mdash; everything listed here is still experimental. To use these features, you may need to [use Expo CLI on `main`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/%40expo/cli#contributing).

Expo Router can automatically split your JavaScript bundle based on the route files using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). This enables faster development as only the routes you navigate to will be bundled or loaded into memory. This can also be useful for reducing the initial bundle size for your application.

Apps using the Hermes Engine will not benefit as much from bundle splitting as the bytecode is already memory mapped ahead of time. However, it will improve your over-the-air updates, React Server Components, and web support.

> When bundling for production, all suspense boundaries **will be disabled** and there will be no loading states.

## How it works

All Routes are wrapped inside a suspense boundary and are loaded asynchronously. This means that the first time you navigate to a route, it will take a little longer to load. However, once it is loaded, it will be cached and subsequent visits will be instant. The [Suspense fallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading) or loading state **cannot be customized** at this time. We plan to add support in the future via a **route+loading.js** file.

Loading errors are handled in the parent route, via the [`ErrorBoundary`](/router/routing/errors) export.

Async routes cannot be statically filtered during development, so all files will be treated as routes even if they don't export a default component. After the component is bundled and loaded, then any invalid route will use a fallback warning screen. This behavior is development-only and will not be present in production.

## Static rendering

The current static rendering system (React) doesn't support React Suspense, so async routes will be disabled on web when rendering static pages. This will be improved in the future.

## Setup

Enable the feature by setting the `asyncRoutes` option to `development` in your [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/):

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-router",
        {
          "origin": "https://acme.com",
          "asyncRoutes": "development"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

You can set platform-specific settings (`default`, `android`, `ios` or `web`) for `asyncRoutes` using an object:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-router",
        {
          "origin": "https://acme.com",
          "asyncRoutes": {
            "android": false,
            "default": "development"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, when you are about to start your project, you can use the `--clear` flag to clear the Metro cache. This will ensure that the routes are loaded asynchronously:

<Terminal
  cmd={['$ npx expo start --clear', '', '# Or when exporting', '$ npx expo export --clear']}
  cmdCopy="$ npx expo export package"
/>
