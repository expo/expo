You can redirect a request to a different URL based on some in-app criteria. Expo Router supports a number of different redirection patterns.

## Redirect

You can immediately redirect from a particular screen by using the `Redirect` component:

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
/* @info */
import { Redirect } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */

export default function Page() {
  /* @info Some logic to determine if the user is logged in. */
  const { user } = useAuth();
  /* @end */

  if (!user) {
    /* @info Redirect to the login screen if the user is not authenticated. */
    return <Redirect href="/login" />;
    /* @end */
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome Back!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

You can also redirect imperatively with the `useRouter` hook:

```jsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter, useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router';

function MyScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useFocusEffect(() => {
    // Call the replace method to redirect to a new route without adding to the history.
    // We do this in a useFocusEffect to ensure the redirect happens every time the screen
    // is focused.
    router.replace('/profile/settings');
  });

  return <Text>My Screen</Text>;
}
```
