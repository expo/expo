You can grant other users access to the projects belonging to your Personal Account or Organizations. The type of access depends on the granted role.

## Add members

You can invite new members to your Personal Account, or any account you administrate, from the [Members page](https://expo.dev/settings/members) in your dashboard. You can only add users with Expo accounts as members; you can direct them to [https://expo.dev/signup](https://expo.dev/signup) if they don't have an account yet. You may have up to 100 members and pending invitations combined for a single account.

> When adding new developers to your projects, who are publishing updates or creating new builds, make sure to add the [`owner`](/versions/latest/config/app/#owner) property to your project's app config.

## Manage access

Access for members is managed through a role-based system. Users can have the _owner_, _admin_, _developer_, or _viewer_ role within Personal Accounts.

| Role          | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**     | Can take any action on an account or any projects, including deleting them. (Note: the Owner role is not available on your Personal Account)              |
| **Admin**     | Can control most settings on your account, including signing up for paid services, changing permissions of other users, and managing programmatic access. |
| **Developer** | Can create new projects, make new builds, release updates, and manage credentials.                                                                        |
| **Viewer**    | Can only view your projects through Expo Go, but can't modify your projects in any way.                                                                   |

## Remove members

To remove members, go to the [Members](https://expo.dev/settings/members) page and revoke access.
