import { Step } from '~/ui/components/Step';
import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

SSO is available for [Enterprise Plan](https://expo.dev/pricing) customers. To get started, contact us and we'll help you set it up for your organization.

> The Expo SSO system currently formally supports [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), but we implement the [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) specification and are working to verify additional compatible identity providers. If you use another identity provider and are interested in SSO, let us know.

## SSO user sign in

### Expo website

<Step label="1">
  Navigate to [expo.dev/sso-login](https://expo.dev/sso-login) and enter the account name of your
  organization. You can create a link that pre-fills the organization name. For example,
  [expo.dev/sso-login/test-org](https://expo.dev/sso-login/test-org) pre-fills `test-org`.
</Step>

<Step label="2">Log in to your identity provider (IdP).</Step>

<Step label="3">
  Next, you'll be prompted to select an Expo username. This will be the username for your Expo
  account.
</Step>

### Expo CLI

> Available with SDK 50 and above. For previous versions, the Expo CLI will use your SSO account after logging in via the EAS CLI.

When using the Expo CLI, you can run the following command to log in to your Expo account.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo login --sso']} />

You will be prompted to log in via the Expo website in a browser and will be redirected back to the CLI upon completion.

### EAS CLI

When using the EAS CLI, you can run the following command to log in to your Expo account.

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas login --sso']} />

You will be prompted to log in via the Expo website in a browser and will be redirected back to the CLI upon completion.

### Expo Go

<Step label="1">
  Click the **Continue with SSO** button on the sign-in page when going through the sign-in flow.
</Step>

<Step label="2">Follow the [above steps](#expo-website) to sign in to the Expo website.</Step>

## SSO user restrictions

SSO users are like regular users. However, there are a few known exceptions:

- SSO users can only belong to their SSO organization. They also cannot create additional organizations.
- SSO users cannot leave their SSO organization. Doing so deletes their SSO user.
- SSO users cannot log in to the Expo forums.
- SSO users cannot subscribe to EAS for their personal accounts.

## SSO administration

Both new organizations and existing organizations can enable SSO as a sign in option. Organizations with existing non-SSO members can enable SSO and then direct new members to the SSO sign-in page, while existing users continue to use their current Expo credentials. To support external contributors, SSO-enabled organizations also allow inviting additional non-SSO users via email.

### Transitioning existing users to SSO

Regular users may be a member of one or many personal, team, and organization accounts while SSO users belong exclusively to their organization account. Thus, existing users cannot be directly converted into SSO users. However, a regular user who's already a member of your organization may create a second user by going to the [SSO login page](https://expo.dev/sso-login). Then, their regular user can be removed from the organization.

To transition from using a regular Expo account to an SSO account, follow these steps:

<Step label="1">
  Check if you're already logged in at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev). If so, log out.
</Step>

<Step label="2">
  Go to the [SSO login page](https://expo.dev/sso-login) and follow the prompts, such as entering
  your organization name, creating a new Expo username, and logging in to your identity provider.
</Step>

<Step label="3">
  By default, your new SSO user will have the View Only role. If you need a different role, ask an
  Admin or Owner to update your role in [member
  settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/members).
</Step>

<Step label="4">Run `eas login --sso` to switch to your new account on the CLI.</Step>

<Step label="5">
  At this time, the Admin or Owner can remove your old user from the organization. In [member
  settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/members), the list of organization members
  indicates whether a user is an SSO or non-SSO user. The Admin or Owner can click the dropdown next
  to the old user and click **Remove member**.
</Step>

<Step label="6">
  If you no longer need your old user account, log out of your new SSO account, then log in to your
  old account and go to [user settings](https://expo.dev/settings). Scroll down and click **Delete
  Account**. **Note that this will delete any projects under your old user account.** It will not
  affect any projects owned by the organization.
</Step>

> If you wish to reuse your old username on your new SSO user account, you can go to [user settings](https://expo.dev/settings) under your old user and rename it before creating your SSO account. Alternatively, you can rename your SSO user account's Expo username after deleting your old user. While Expo usernames need to be unique, it is OK if your email address on your identity provider matches the email address of your old user.

### Remove SSO users

If someone has left your organization, remove or disable them in your IdP. Depending on the token refresh duration you configured with your IdP, the removed user will subsequently lose access to their Expo account.
If you wish to remove them ahead of that time or you wish to remove them to clean up users on your account, you may do so on the organization member settings page:

<Step label="1">

Navigate to your [organization account member settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/settings/members).

</Step>

<Step label='2'>

Click the dropdown next to the member you wish to delete, and click **Delete SSO user**.

> **warning** This will delete their personal account and all data associated with it. All data in your organization account will remain unaffected.

</Step>

### Change billing or discontinue use of SSO

An active Enterprise Plan is required to continue using SSO. [Contact us](https://expo.dev/contact) if you wish to discontinue the use of SSO or change your plan.

To ensure uninterrupted access to your organization whether or not SSO is enabled, SSO organizations must keep at least one non-SSO user with the Owner role as a member.

### Delete SSO organization

Once SSO is configured for an organization, account deletion must be done manually by the Expo team. [Contact us](https://expo.dev/contact) for assistance.
