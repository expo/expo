The installation steps on this page are only required to add the `expo-dev-client` library to a React Native or a bare project. To add the `expo-dev-client` library to an existing managed project, see ["Create a development build"](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

If you're starting your project, you can create a new project with our `with-dev-client` template. Run the following command to initialize the project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app -e with-dev-client']} />

Otherwise, if you already have an existing React Native or a bare project, follow the steps below to add `expo-dev-client` to it.

<Step label="1">

## Install Expo modules

If you created your project with `npx react-native init` and do not have any other Expo packages installed, **you will need to [install Expo modules](/bare/installing-expo-modules)** before proceeding.

Otherwise, if you already have `expo` and/or other Expo modules up and running, you can skip this step.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Install expo-dev-client

Add the `expo-dev-client` library to your **package.json**:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

If your project has an **ios/** directory on disk, run the following command to fully install the native code for `expo-dev-client`:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

If your project doesn't have an **ios/** directory, you can skip this step.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Configure deep links

Development builds use deep links to open projects from the QR code. If you have added a custom deep link scheme to your project, your development build will use it. However, if this isn't the case, you need to configure the deep link support for your app. The `uri-scheme` package will do this for you once you have chosen a scheme.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx uri-scheme add <your scheme>']} />

For more information, see [uri-scheme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme).

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Add additional optional configuration

For certain type of errors, you can provide more helpful error messages. To turn this on, import `expo-dev-client` in the project's **index** file (in the managed workflow, you need to add this import on top of the **App.&lbrace;js|tsx&rbrace;**). Make sure that the import statement is above `import App from './App'`.

```js
import 'expo-dev-client';
...
import App from "./App";
```

For more information, see [Error handling](/develop/development-builds/use-development-builds/#add-error-handling).

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Build and install

You're now ready to [build your first development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/#initialize-eas-build).
