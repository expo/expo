import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

The installation steps on this page are only required to add the `expo-dev-client` library to a React Native or a bare project.

> To add the `expo-dev-client` library to an existing managed project, see [Create development builds](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

If you're starting your project, you can create a new project with our `with-dev-client` template. Run the following command to initialize the project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx crna -t with-dev-client']} />

Otherwise, if you already have an existing React Native or a bare project, follow the steps below to add `expo-dev-client` to it.

<Step label="1">

## Set up Expo modules

If you created your project with `npx react-native init` and do not have any other Expo packages installed, **you'd need to [install Expo modules](/bare/installing-expo-modules)** before proceeding.

Otherwise, if you already have `expo` and/or other Expo modules up and running, you can skip this step.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Installation

Add the `expo-dev-client` library to your **package.json**:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

If your project has an **ios/** directory on disk, run the following command to fully install the native code for `expo-dev-client`:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

If your project doesn't have an **ios/** directory, you can skip this step.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Basic configuration

Development builds use deep links to open projects from the QR code. If you have added a custom deep link scheme to your project, your development build will use it. However, if this isn't the case, you need to configure the deep link support for your app. The `uri-scheme` package will do this for you once you have chosen a scheme.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx uri-scheme add <your scheme>']} />

For more information, see [uri-scheme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme).

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Optional configuration

There are a few more changes you can make to get the best experience, but you [can skip ahead to building](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/#create-a-development-build-for-the-device) if you prefer.

### Disable packager autostart when building for iOS

When you start your project on iOS, the metro bundler will start automatically. This behavior might not be ideal when you want to use `npx expo start`. Our recommended solution is to remove the `Start Packager` action from building scripts. To do that you need to open the Xcode, go to **Build Phases** and remove the **Start Packager** action.

### Add better error handlers

For certain type of errors, you can provide more helpful error messages. To turn this on, import `expo-dev-client` in the project's **index** file (in the managed workflow, you need to add this import on top of the **App.&lbrace;js|tsx&rbrace;**). Make sure that the import statement is above `import App from './App'`.

```js
import 'expo-dev-client';
...
import App from "./App";
```

For more information, see [Error handling](/develop/development-builds/use-development-builds/#add-error-handling).

### Loading published updates

Development builds can also open and preview published updates to your app.

To add this feature, install `expo-updates` in your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates']} />

After doing so, if your project has an **ios/** directory on disk, you will need to reinstall CocoaPods:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx pod-install']} />

</Step>

## Build and install

You're now ready to [build your first development build](develop/development-builds/create-a-build/#initialize-eas-build).
