A bare React Native app is a project where developers make direct changes to their native **android** and **ios** project directories rather than continuously generating them on demand using [app config](/workflow/configuration/) and [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild). All tools and services offered by Expo including [EAS](/eas), Expo CLI, and the libraries in the Expo SDK, are built around bare React Native apps.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with a React Native app, make sure you have set up your developer environment from [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Get started

To bootstrap a new React Native project, use `create-expo-app` and run the following command:

<Terminal
  cmd={['# Create a new bare project', '$ npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum']}
  cmdCopy="npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum"
/>

> If you have an existing project or want to bootstrap with `npx react-native init`, then you need to [install the `expo` package](/bare/installing-expo-modules) manually.

Navigate into your project directory, and run the following commands to build the app locally for each platform:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build your native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '',
    '# Build your native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
/>

> Learn more about [compiling native apps](/more/expo-cli/#compiling).
