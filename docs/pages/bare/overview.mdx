A bare React Native app is a project where developers make direct changes to their native **android** and **ios** project directories rather than continuously generating them on demand using the [app config (**app.json**) and prebuild](/workflow/prebuild). All tools and services offered by Expo including [EAS](/eas), Expo CLI, and the libraries in the Expo SDK, are built around bare React Native apps.

Before you get started with a React Native app, make sure you set up your environment for [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

To bootstrap a new React Native project, you can use `create-expo-app`. If you have an existing project or want to bootstrap with `npx react-native init`, then you will need to [install the `expo` package](/bare/installing-expo-modules) manually.

<Terminal
  cmd={['# Create a new native project', '$ npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum']}
  cmdCopy="npx create-expo-app --template bare-minimum"
/>

Navigate into your project directory, then build the apps locally:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build your native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '',
    '# Build your native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
/>
