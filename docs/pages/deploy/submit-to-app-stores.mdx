  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Include a bundle identifier in app.json">
    Include your app's bundle identifier in **app.json**:

    ```json app.json
    {
      "ios": {
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account">
    Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:

    <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli && eas login']} />

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={4} title="Build a production app">
    You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction/):

    <Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --profile production']} />

    Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform ios --profile production --local` or with Xcode.

  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can start the submission process.

Run the following command to submit a build to the Apple App Store:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform ios']} />

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app.

## Google Play Store

<Prerequisites numberOfRequirements={7}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Sign up for a Google Play Developer account">
    A Google Play Developer account is required to submit your app to the Google Play Store. You can sign up for a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create a Google Service Account">
    EAS requires you to upload and configure a Google Service Account Key to submit your Android app to the Google Play Store. You can create one with the [uploading a Google Service Account Key for Play Store submissions with EAS](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md) guide.
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Create an app on Google Play Console">

Run the following command to submit a build to the Google Play Store:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android']} />

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app.

## Build and submit automatically

You can automatically create builds and submit them to the app stores with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started/#configure-your-project), add a file named **.eas/workflows/build-and-submit.yml** at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

```yaml .eas/workflows/build-and-submit.yml
name: Build and submit

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build_android:
    name: Build Android app
    type: build
    params:
      platform: android
      profile: production
  build_ios:
    name: Build iOS app
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
      profile: production
  submit_android:
    name: Submit Android
    type: submit
    needs: [build_android]
    params:
      build_id: ${{ needs.build_android.outputs.build_id }}
  submit_ios:
    name: Submit iOS
    type: submit
    needs: [build_ios]
    params:
      build_id: ${{ needs.build_ios.outputs.build_id }}
```

The workflow above will create Android and iOS builds on every commit to your project's `main` branch, then submit them to the Google Play and Apple App Store respectively. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run build-and-submit.yml']} />

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples).

## Manual submission to app stores

You can also submit your app manually to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
