To submit your app to the app stores, you'll need to create a production build. This build is optimized for performance and size, and it includes all the necessary assets and configurations for the app stores.

## Prerequisites

Paid developer accounts are required to submit builds to the app stores. You will need the following:

- A [Google Play Developer](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/) membership ($25 one-time fee)
- An [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) membership ($99 per year)

## Configure over-the-air updates

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

## Create a production build
