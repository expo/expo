name: Deploy web

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo export --platform web']} />

> Remember to re-run this command every time before deploying when you make changes to your web app.

## Initial deployment

To publish your web app, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas deploy']} />

After running this command for the first time, you'll be prompted to select a preview subdomain for your project. This subdomain is a prefix used to create a preview URL and is used for production deployments. For example, in `https://test-app--1234.expo.app`, `test-app` is the preview subdomain.

Once your deployment is complete, the EAS CLI will output a preview URL to access your deployed app.

## Production deployment

To create a production deployment, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas deploy --prod']} />

Once your deployment is complete, the EAS CLI will output a production URL to access your deployed app.

## Deploy automatically

You can automatically deploy your app to the web with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started/#configure-your-project), add a file named **.eas/workflows/deploy-web.yml** at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

```yaml .eas/workflows/deploy-web.yml
name: Deploy web

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  deploy_web:
    name: Deploy web
    type: deploy
    params:
      prod: true
```

The workflow above will create a web deployment on every commit to your project's `main` branch. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run deploy-web.yml']} />

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples).

You can learn more about setting up [deployment aliases](/eas/hosting/deployments-and-aliases/), using a [custom domain](/eas/hosting/custom-domain/), or [deploying an API Route](/router/web/api-routes/#deployment).
