import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

You can send over-the-air updates containing critical bug fixes and improvements to your users.

## Get started

> If you've published [previews](/review/share-previews-with-your-team/) or created a [build](/deploy/build-project/) before, you may have already set up updates and can skip this section.

To set up updates, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

After the command completes, you'll need to make new builds before continuing to the next section.

## Send an update

To send an update, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --channel production']} />

This command will create an update and make it available to builds of your app that are configured to receive updates on the `production` channel. This channel is defined in [**eas.json**](/eas/json/#channel).

You can verify the update works by force closing the app and reopening it two times. The update should be applied on the second launch.
