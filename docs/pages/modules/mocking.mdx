The recommended way to write unit tests for an Expo project is to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and the `jest-expo` preset.

To write a unit test for an app that uses native code, you need to mock native calls.
The term **Mocking** means to replace the actual implementation of a function with a fake version that does not perform any actions. This approach is useful for running unit tests on a local computer as it involves bypassing the need for native code which is only available on a device, and any code that calls native functions on a local machine will not work.

Expo SDK includes a set of default mocks for each of our community packages. You can also mock any JS code yourself using built-in Jest APIs such as [mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions).

However, to provide default mocks in your Expo Module, we offer a method to bundle them. This ensures that when your module user runs unit tests, they will automatically use a mocked implementation.

## Providing mocks for a module

Create a file with the same name as the native module you want to mock and place it in your module's **mocks** directory. Make sure to export the mock implementation from this file.
The `jest-expo` preset will automatically return the exported functions because of a `requireNativeModule` call when running during a unit test.

For example, the `expo-clipboard` library has a native module called `ExpoClipboard`. You will create a **ExpoClipboard.ts** in the **mocks** directory to mock it.

```ts ExpoClipboard.ts
export async function hasStringAsync(): Promise<boolean> {
  return false;
}
```

Now, in a unit test, calling `ExpoClipboard.hasStringAsync()` returns `false`.

## Automatic generation of mocks

Maintaining mocks for native modules can be a lot of work if the native module has multiple methods. To make this easier, we provide a script that automatically generates mocks for all native functions in a module.
It works for generating mocks in TypeScript and JavaScript based on the Swift implementation in your module.

To use this script, you have to install [SourceKitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) framework and run the `generate-ts-mocks` command in your module.

<Terminal
  cmdCopy="brew install sourcekitten && npx expo-modules-test-core generate-ts-mocks"
  cmd={['$ brew install sourcekitten', '$ npx expo-modules-test-core generate-ts-mocks']}
/>

The command above generates **ExpoModuleName.ts** in the **mocks** directory of your module. It contains a mock implementation for each native method and view in your module.

> **Tip:** You can also run `generate-js-mocks` to generate mocks in JavaScript.
