There are two ways to get started with the Expo Module API: you can either initialize a new module from scratch or add the Expo Module API to an existing module. This guide will walk you through creating a new module from scratch, and the ["Integrating in an existing library" guide](/modules/existing-library) covers the latter case.

## Creating a new module

To create a new Expo module from scratch, run the `create-expo-module` script as shown below. The script will ask you a few questions and then generate the native Expo module along with the example app for iOS and Android that uses your new module.

<Terminal cmd={[`$ npx create-expo-module my-module`]} />

## Running the example project

> **Note:** If you're using Windows, you can open the example project by opening the `android` and/or `ios` directory in Android Studio and Xcode respectively,

Navigate to the module directory and then open the iOS and/or Android example project by running the following commands:

<Terminal cmd={[`$ cd my-module`, `$ npm run open:android`, `$ npm run open:ios`]} />

Now, you can run the example project on your device or simulator/emulator. When the project compiles and runs, you will see "Hello world! 👋" on the screen.

## Making a change

### iOS

Open up `MyModuleModule.swift` in Xcode (`⌘+o` and search for `MyModuleModule.swift`) and change the `hello` method to return a different string. For example, you can change it to return `"Hello world! 🌎🍎"`. Re-build the app and you should see your change.

### Android

Open up `MyModuleModule.kt` in Android Studio (`⌘+o` and search for `MyModuleModule.kt`) and change the `hello` method to return a different string. For example, you can change it to return `"Hello world! 🌎🤖"`. Re-build the app and you should see your change.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to initialize a module and make simple changes to it, you can continue to a tutorial or dive right into the API reference.

- ["Creating a native module"](/modules/native-module-tutorial) walks you through creating a simple but complete native module to access device APIs through JavaScript.
- ["Creating a native view module"](/modules/native-view-tutorial) covers how to create a simple native view that can be used as a React component in a React Native app.
- ["Module API Reference"](/modules/module-api/) outlines the Expo Module API and provides information for common patterns like sending events from native to JavaScript. You will refer to this page often when building a module.
