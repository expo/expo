## React Native Stylesheet API

Expo Router supports styling using React Native's `StyleSheet.create` method as well as inline styles.

### Limits of React Native styling

React Native's in-built `StyleSheet` API was designed as a low-level API and does not provide support for modern features that simplify building universal applications.

When targeting the web, we highly recommend using a different method of styling. Methods such as ([CSS](/router/styling/css_web/)) allow responsive styling while streaming and avoid flashes of unstyled content.

## CSS

> The following sections refer to upcoming Expo Router features which are experimental, not covered by semantic versioning and you may need to be using the latest version on `main`.

Expo Router provides a CSS interop for your application. This allows you to style your application using the CSS language or use a styling solution that compiles to CSS. This is not a full CSS implementation. Think of it as "CSS with the good bits".

### Features

The CSS-interop provides React Native polyfills for the following common CSS features:

- Additional relative units
  - `vw`,`vh`
- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
  - [Media features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#targeting_media_features)
  - [prefered-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
  - [Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_Media_Queries_for_Accessibility)
- [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries)
  - Dimentions
  - Styles
- Style variables
- Psuedo classes
- Works with web streaming

Additionally, it includes the following bundling features:

- When developing locally, changes to stylesheets will instantly reflect changes as edits are made.
- When building for production, CSS files will be minified and common styles grouped.

### Usage

#### Use `className`

Expo Router supports styling components via the `className` prop. Simply `import` your stylesheet in the top-most **\_layout** file.

```js app/_layout.js
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';
/* @info Import your styles! */
import 'global.css';
/* @end */
export default function RootLayout() {
  return <Slot />;
}
```

```js app/index.js
export default function MyApp() {
  return <div className="css-selector" />;
}
```

#### Use CSS Modules

CSS Modules are available by using the `.module.css` extension. They locally scope CSS by creating unique class names and work similarly to React Native styles.

```js app/index.js
import styles from './styles.module.css';
export default function MyApp() {
  return <div styles={styles.container} />;
}
```

### Behavior differences

#### Flexbox

Yoga (React Native's layout engine) uses a slightly different Flexbox model than web browsers, as such there are minor behavioral differences.

| Feature        | Difference                                                | Solution                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| flex-direction | Native defaults to `column` while web uses `row`.         | Explicitly set `flex-direction`. |
| align-content  | Native defaults to `flex-start` while web uses `stretch`. | Explicitly set `align-content`.  |
| flex-shrink    | Native defaults to `0` while web uses `1`.                | Explicitly set `flex-shrink`.    |

Additionally, React Native's numeric representation of `flex` is not supported and instead represents the **One-value syntax** of [flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex).

```css
flex: <value>;
/* expands to */
flex-grow: <value>;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0;
```

#### No style inheritance

The CSS interop does not support [CSS Cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade). As such, allow CSS rules should be written as single selectors. We recommend using a CSS methodology such as:

- Atomic CSS (https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/)
- BEM (https://getbem.com/introduction/)

#### Selectors

On native, only single-class selectors are used.

```css
// ❌
div {
  color: red;
}
// ❌
.container .text {
  color: red;
}
// ✔️
.text-red {
  color: red;
}
```

You can still specify them, as they are still valid for web, but we recommend limiting usage to only `html`/`body`

#### Specificity

> We are working on resolving this discrepancy.

Native styles are resolved right-to-left, while Web styles are resolved via [CSS Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).

#### rem

`rem` is the relative CSS unit for the Font size of the root element. On native, the font size defaults to `14` and is _not relative_ to your root element. If you which to dynamically change the `rem` value, you need to set `inlineRem: false` in your **metro.config.js** file. Now the value of `rem` can be set by calling `StyleSheet.rem.set(<number>)`.

## Troubleshooting

### Elements are not appearing on Native

This is most likely due to minor differences in [React Native's flexbox model](#flexbox). A common offender is the differences between `flex-shrink` and simply setting `flex: 1` will resolve your issue.
