import { BoxLink } from '~/ui/components/BoxLink';
import { BookOpen02Icon } from '@expo/styleguide-icons';
import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

Expo Router uses "links" to move between pages in the app. This is conceptually similar to how the web works with `<a>` tags and the `href` attribute.

<FileTree files={['app/index.js', 'app/about.js', 'app/user/[id].js']} />

In the following example, there are two `<Link />` components which navigate to different routes.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js app/index.js
/* @info Import the <b>Link</b> React component from <b>expo-router</b> */
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      /* @info Tapping this will link to the <b>about</b> page */
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    /* @end */

      /* @info Tapping this will navigate to the dynamic route <b>user/[id]</b> where <b>id=bacon</b> */
      <Link href="/user/bacon">View user</Link>
    /* @end */
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Buttons

The Link component wraps the children in a `<Text>` component by default, this is useful for accessibility but not always desired. You can customize the component by passing the `asChild` prop, which will forward all props to the first child of the `Link` component. The child component must support the `onPress` and `onClick` props, `href` and `accessibilityRole` will also be passed down.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
import { Pressable, Text } from "react-native";
import { Link } from "expo-router";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    /* @info The <b>onPress</b> event that navigates to <b>/other</b> will be passed to <b>Pressable</b> */
    <Link href="/other" asChild>
    /* @end */
      <Pressable>
        <Text>Home</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

## Imperative navigation

You may want to navigate from a global store when a user logs in or out. You can use the `router` object to navigate imperatively (outside of React).

```js
import { router } from 'expo-router';

export function logout() {
  /* @info Navigate to <b>/login</b> */
  router.replace('/login');
  /* @end */
}
```

The `router` object is immutable and contains the following functions:

- **push**: `(href: Href) => void` Navigate to a route. You can provide a full path like **/profile/settings** or a relative path like **../settings**. Navigate to dynamic routes by passing an object like `{ pathname: 'profile', params: { id: '123' } }`.
- **replace**: `(href: Href) => void` Same API as push but replaces the current route in the history instead of pushing a new one. This is useful for redirects.
- **back**: `() => void` Navigate back to previous route.
- **setParams**: `(params: Record<string, string>) => void` Update the query params for the currently selected route.

## Linking to dynamic routes

Dynamic routes and query parameters can be provided statically or with the convenience **Href** object.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js app/index.js
/* @info Import the <b>Link</b> React component from <b>expo-router</b> */
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link 
        href={{ 
          /* @info Navigate to <b>/user/bacon</b> */
          pathname: "/user/[id]", 
          params: { id: 'bacon' }
          /* @end */
        }}>
          View user
        </Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Replacing screens

By default, links "push" routes onto the navigation stack. This means that the previous screen will be available when the user navigates back. You can use the `replace` prop to replace the current screen instead of pushing a new one.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js app/index.js
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link 
        /* @info Navigate to <b>/feed</b> without adding it to the stack. */
        replace
      /* @end */
        href="/feed">
        Login
      </Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Use **router.replace()** to replace the current screen imperatively.

Native navigation does not always support `replace`. For example on Twitter, you wouldn't be able to "replace" directly from a profile to a tweet, this is because the UI requires a back button to return to the feed or other top-level tab screen. In this case, replace would switch to the feed tab, and push the tweet route on top of it, or if you were on a different tweet inside the feed tab, it would replace the current tweet with the new tweet. This exact behavior can be obtained in Expo Router by using [`unstable_settings`](/router/advance/router-settings).

## Autocomplete

Expo Router can automatically generate static TypeScript types for all routes in your app. This allows you to use autocomplete for `href`s and get warnings when invalid links are used. Learn more: [Statically Typed Routes](/router/reference/typed-routes).

## Web behavior

Expo Router supports the standard `<a>` element when running on web, however this will perform a full-page server-navigation. This is slower and doesn't take full advantage of React. Instead, the Expo Router `<Link>` component will perform client-side navigation, this will preserve the state of the website and navigate faster.

Client-side navigation works with both single-page apps, and [static rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering).
