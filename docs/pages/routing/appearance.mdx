import { BoxLink } from '~/ui/components/BoxLink';
import { BookOpen02Icon } from '@expo/styleguide-icons';

There are three major elements that you can use to customize the appearance of your app:

- Fonts
- Images
- Splash screen

## Fonts

Expo Router extends the `expo-splash-screen` API to prevent white flash,

```js app/_layout.js
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  /* @info Import `SplashScreen` from `expo-router` instead of `expo-splash-screen` */
  SplashScreen,
  /* @end */
  // This example uses a basic Layout component, but you can use any Layout.
  Slot,
} from 'expo-router';

import { useFonts, Inter_500Medium } from '@expo-google-fonts/inter';

/* @info Prevent hiding the splash screen after the navigation has mounted. */
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
/* @end */

export default function Layout() {
  // Load the font `Inter_500Medium`
  const [fontsLoaded] = useFonts({
    Inter_500Medium,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (fontsLoaded) {
      // Hide the splash screen after the fonts have loaded and the
      // UI is ready.
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [fontsLoaded]);

  // Prevent rendering until the font has loaded
  if (!fontsLoaded) {
    return null;
  }

  // Render the children routes now that all the assets are loaded.
  return <Slot />;
}
```

## Images

We recommend you use Expo Image for the best cross-platform experience:

## Splash screen

Splash screens are required on native platforms. Expo Router automatically orchestrates the native splash screen to keep it visible until the first route is rendered, this applies to any route that the user deep links into. To enable this functionality, install expo-splash-screen in your project.

The default behavior is to hide the splash screen when the first route is rendered, this is optimal for the majority of routes. For some routes, you may want to prolong the splash screen until additional data or asset loading has concluded. This can be achieved with the `SplashScreen` module from `expo-router`. If `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync` is called before the splash screen is hidden, then the splash screen will remain visible until the `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` function has been invoked.

```js app/index.tsx
import { SplashScreen } from 'expo-router';

/* @info Prevent hiding the splash screen after the navigation has mounted. */
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
/* @end */

export default function App() {
  const [isReady, setReady] = React.useState(false);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Perform some sort of async data or asset fetching.
    setTimeout(() => {
      // When all loading is setup, unmount the splash screen component.
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
      setReady(true);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return <Text>My App</Text>;
}
```
