You can prevent a segment from showing in the URL by using the group syntax `()`.

- **app/root/home.js** which matches `/root/home`
- **app/(root)/home.js** which matches `/home`

This is useful for adding layouts without adding additional segments to the URL.

## Shared routes

To match the same URL with different layouts, use **groups** with overlapping child routes. This pattern is very common in native apps. For example, in the Twitter app, a profile can be viewed in every tab (such as home, search, and profile). However, there is only one URL that is required to access this route.

In the example below, **app/\_layout.js** is the tab bar and each route has its own header. The **app/(profile)/[user].js** route is shared between each tab.

<FileTree
  files={[
    'app/_layout.js',
    'app/(home)/_layout.js',
    'app/(home)/[user].js',
    'app/(search)/_layout.js',
    'app/(search)/[user].js',
    'app/(profile)/_layout.js',
    'app/(profile)/[user].js',
  ]}
/>

> When reloading the page, the first match (alphabetically) will be rendered.
> Shared routes can be navigated directly by including the group name in the route. For example, `/(search)/baconbrix` navigates to `/baconbrix` in the "search" layout.

## Arrays

Instead of defining the same route multiple times with different layouts, use the array syntax `(,)` to duplicate the children of a group. For example, **app/(home,search)/[user].js** creates **app/(home)/[user].js** and **app/(search)/[user].js** in memory.

You can use the `segment` prop of a layout to distinguish between the two routes.

```js app/(home,search)/_layout.js
export default function DynamicLayout({ segment }) {
  if (segment === '(search)') {
    return <SearchStack />;
  }
  return <Stack />;
}
```

## Layouts

Pages on their own fill the entire screen. Moving between them is a full-page transition with no animation. In native apps, users expect shared elements like headers and tab bars to persist between pages. These can be created using **layout routes**.

### Create a layout route

To create a layout route for a directory, create a file named **\_layout.js** in the directory, and export a React component as `default`.

```js app/home/_layout.js
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';
export default function HomeLayout() {
  return <Slot />;
}
```

From the above example, `Slot` will render the selected child route. This component can be wrapped with other components to create a layout.

```js app/home/_layout.js
import { Slot } from 'expo-router';
export default function HomeLayout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Slot />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Native layouts

Mobile app users expect a refined platform-specific look and native feel for layouts. Expo Router provides a few drop-in native layouts that you can use to easily achieve familiar native behavior.

- `Stack`: Render a stack of screens like a deck of cards with a header on top. This is a native stack navigator that uses native animations and gestures. Extends the [`@react-navigation/native-stack`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator) library.
- `Tabs`: Render screens with a tab bar below. Extends the [`@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/) library.
- `Navigator`: Render screens in a generic, unstyled wrapper. This is useful for creating custom layouts.

```js app/home/_layout.js
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
export default function HomeLayout() {
    return (
        <Stack screenOptions={{ ... }} />
    )
}
```
