import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

System requirements:

- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- macOS, Windows (Powershell and WSL 2), and Linux are supported.

We recommend starting with the default project created by `create-expo-app`. The default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app@latest']} />

> The default project template includes [Expo Router](/router/introduction/) library installed to build multi-screen apps with Expo. You can choose a different template by using the `--template` option. For example, using this option, you can choose the `blank` template to create a project with minimum required libraries installed and without navigation configured.

## Next step

You have a project. Now it's time to set up your development environment so that you can start developing.
