[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) is a free, [open-source](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/home) sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native on Android and iOS devices. You can install it directly from App Stores, and get up and running within minutes &mdash; no need to install a native toolchain and compile an app.

Expo Go is not recommended for building production-quality apps &mdash; use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) instead. It's also not recommended for [deploying/distributing apps](/deploy/build-project/). That said, everything you learn while working in Expo Go will be transferable to development builds, and you're likely to come back to Expo Go along your journey when you want to try new ideas in a quick new project sandbox. It's a great place to start!

## Install Expo Go on your device

It is available on both the Android Play Store and iOS App Store.

- [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) - iOS 13 and greater

When you run `npx expo start` in your project, [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) starts a [development server](/more/expo-cli/#develop) and generates a QR code. On Android, you can open the Expo Go app on your device and scan the QR code to connect to the dev server. On iOS, use the device's camera to scan the QR code.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

When Expo Go connects to the dev server, the server returns a JSON **manifest** file that describes the project. Expo Go uses this manifest to download the JavaScript bundle and any assets required to run the project. Then, the [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine) executes this JavaScript bundle to render the React Native app.

The manifest is similar to an **index.html** on the web. It is served from the root URL `/` and allows downloading the project script code from `bundleUrl`. The manifest can be customized using the app config (**app.json**, **app.config.js**). Additional fields like `icon` and `splash` can be used to customize how Expo Go or `expo-dev-client` presents the app.

```json
{
  "name": "My New Project",
  "entryPoint": "index.js",
  "bundleUrl": "http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios"
}
```

### SDK versions

Expo Go supports multiple [**SDK versions**](/versions/latest/). A new Expo SDK version is released approximately three times each year. Each time a new version is added to Expo Go, an old version is dropped. You can see the supported SDK versions in the Expo Go app by navigating to the settings page.

<Collapsible summary="What if I open a project with an unsupported SDK version?">

When running a project that was created for an unsupported SDK version in Expo Go, you'll see the following error:
```
"Project is incompatible with this version of Expo Go"
```
To fix this, upgrading your project to a [supported SDK version](/versions/latest/#each-expo-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version) is highly recommended. If you want to learn how to do it, see [Upgrade the project to a new SDK Version](#how-do-i-upgrade-my-project-from).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How do I upgrade my project from an unsupported SDK version?">

Refer to the ["Upgrading Expo SDK" guide](/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough.mdx) for instructions for upgrading to a specific SDK version.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How can I install an older version of Expo Go to run my project?">

If you can't upgrade your project to a newer SDK version, you can still run it using an older version of Expo Go. However, this method will not work for physical iOS devices because it is not possible to install apps directly (sideload). If you need to run your project on a physical iOS device, consider creating a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction).

If you are trying to use this method on a physical Android device, connect it to your computer and enable the **USB Debugging** option. To learn more, see [Android emulators](/workflow/android-studio-emulator) and [iOS simulators](/workflow/ios-simulator)

<Step label="1">
  If installed, remove Expo Go from your device/simulator.
</Step>
<Step label="2">
  Start the development server:
  <Terminal cmd={['npx expo start']}/>
</Step>
<Step label="3">
  Press <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>i</kbd> to run your app on Android or iOS. This will download and install the compatible Expo Go on your device/simulator and open your project in the client.
</Step>

A compatible version Expo Go will be automatically installed on your device/simulator, and your project will open.

## Log in with your Expo account

Open the Expo Go app after it has finished installing. If you have [created an account with Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/#authentication), you can sign in by clicking the **Log In** button in the top header on the **Home** tab. Signing in will make it easier for you to open projects in the Expo Go app while developing them &mdash; they will appear automatically under the **Projects** section on the **Home** tab of the app.

> Sometimes, it can be useful to run your app directly on your computer instead of on a separate physical device. If you would like to set this up, you can learn more about [installing an Android Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator) and [installing the iOS Simulator (macOS only)](/workflow/ios-simulator).
