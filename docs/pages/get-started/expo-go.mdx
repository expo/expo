[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) is a free, [open-source](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/home) client for testing React Native apps on Android and iOS devices without building anything locally. It allows you to open up apps served through Expo CLI and run your projects faster when developing them.

## Install Expo Go on your device

It is available on both the Android Play Store and iOS App Store.

- [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) - iOS 13 and greater

## How it works

Expo Go is a native app that is installed on your device. When you run `npx expo start` in your project, [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) starts a [development server](/more/expo-cli/#develop) and generates a QR code. You can then open the Expo Go app on your device and scan the QR code to connect to the dev server.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

The dev server returns a JSON manifest file that describes the project. Expo Go uses this manifest to download the JavaScript bundle and any assets required to run the project. Then, the [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine) executes this JavaScript bundle to render the React Native app.

You can open and share projects with the members of your [organization](/accounts/account-types/#organizations) by publishing with [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction). Updates are bundled for production environments using the [`npx expo export`](/more/expo-cli/#exporting) command.

### Manifest

The manifest is similar to an **index.html** on the web. It is served from the root URL `/` and allows downloading the project script code from `bundleUrl`. The manifest can be customized using the app config (**app.json**, **app.config.js**). Additional fields like `icon` and `splash` can be used to customize how Expo Go or `expo-dev-client` presents the app.

```json
{
  "name": "My New Project",
  "entryPoint": "index.js",
  "bundleUrl": "http://localhost:19000/index.bundle?platform=ios"
}
```

### SDK Versions

Expo Go uses **SDK versions** that map to a major release of the `expo` and the Expo Go app. You can see the supported SDK versions in the Expo Go app by navigating to the settings page.

We release a new SDK version approximately every quarter. Find out which [versions of React Native map to which versions of the Expo SDK](/versions/latest/#each-expo-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version).

## Login into Expo Go

Open the Expo Go app after it has finished installing. If you have created an account with Expo CLI, you can sign in by clicking the **Login** button in the top header on the **Home** tab. Signing in will make it easier for you to open projects in the Expo Go app while developing them &mdash; they will appear automatically under the **Projects** section on the **Home** tab of the app.

> Sometimes, it can be useful to run your app directly on your computer instead of on a separate physical device. If you would like to set this up, you can learn more about [installing an Android Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator) and [installing the iOS Simulator (macOS only)](/workflow/ios-simulator).

## Production

Expo Go is not intended for public distribution. It is a development client that is not optimized for performance. We offer a suite of tools for building and submitting your apps directly to the app stores. For more information, see [Distribution](/distribution/introduction).

You can create your own Expo Go type app by using the [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) package. This package allows you to create a native client with any custom native code or configuration or a third-party library that requires configuring native code. For more information, see [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

You can view the source code for the [Android](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/android), [iOS](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/ios), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/home) on GitHub.
