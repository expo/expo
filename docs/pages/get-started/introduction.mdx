Expo is a framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. Our framework provides file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more. Expo is open source with an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo) and [Discord](https://chat.expo.dev).

We also make [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas), a set of services that complement the Expo framework in each step of the development process.

There are two ways to get started:

<BoxLink
  title="Automated setup with expo.new"
  description="Create a project, set up your development environment, automatically configure build and update automations, and start developing."
  href="https://expo.new/"
  Icon={Earth02Icon}
/>

<BoxLink
  title="Quick start docs"
  description="Create a project, set up your development environment, and start developing."
  href="/get-started/create-a-project/"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
/>
