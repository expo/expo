To develop applications with Expo, make sure to check out the following requirements and recommended tools.

## Requirements

To use Expo, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended.
  <CALLOUT theme="secondary">As Node.js [officially states](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases". You can install Node.js using a version management tool (such as `nvm` or `volta` or any other of your choice) to switch between different Node.js versions.</CALLOUT>
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) for source control.
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) (for Linux or macOS users).

## Get started

After installing Node.js, you can use `npx` to create a new app.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app --template']} />

<BoxLink

## Expo CLI

[Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) is part of the `expo` package, and you can use it by leveraging `npx` &mdash; a Node.js package runner. To start your app, open the terminal on your development machine and run the `npx expo` command:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Start the development server',
    '$ npx expo',
    '',
    '# See a list of commands in Expo CLI',
    '$ npx expo --help',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="npx expo"
/>

> **info** You don't need macOS to build an iOS app. You only need an iOS device to run a development build. Learn what are [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) and how you can leverage them to build your projects.

## Recommended tools

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for faster and more reliable dependency management. Use this instead of `npm` and `npx`.
- [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Expo Tools VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expo.vscode-expo-tools) for easier debugging and app config autocomplete.

If you are using Yarn, you can bootstrap a new app using the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ yarn create expo']} />

## Windows terminal support

The Expo CLI is compatible with the following terminals on Windows 10 and higher:
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) (the default terminal)
- WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) using a Bash shell

WSL 2 typically requires additional configuration to set up your development environment for testing code on a device using a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) or Expo Go. Learn more about [configuring WSL 2 for Expo development](https://expo.fyi/wsl).
