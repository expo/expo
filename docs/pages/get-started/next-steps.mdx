import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

Here are next steps to continue building your app:

### Reset your project

You can remove the boilerplate code and start fresh with a new project. Run the following command to reset your project:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run reset-project']} />

This command will move the existing files in **app** to **app-example**, then create a new **app** directory with a new **index.tsx** file.

### Develop, review, and deploy

Learn how to develop by reading the docs in the Develop section. You'll learn how to create [UI elements](/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/), add [unit tests](/develop/unit-testing/), include [native modules](/config-plugins/introduction/), and more.

Once you've developed your app, you can share it with your teammates for [review](/review/overview).

Finally, you can [build](/deploy/build-project/) and [submit](/deploy/submit-to-app-stores/) your project to the app stores.
