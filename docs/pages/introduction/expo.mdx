Expo is an [open-source framework](https://github.com/expo/expo/) for apps that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app.

The `expo` npm package enables a suite of incredible features for React Native apps. The `expo` package can be installed in nearly **any React Native project**.
