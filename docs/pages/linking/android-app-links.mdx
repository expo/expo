To configure Android App Links for your app, you need to:

- Add `intentFilters` and set `autoVerify` to true in your project's app config
- Set up two-way association to verify your website and native app

## Add `intentFilters` to the app config

Configure your app config by adding the `android.intentFilters` property and setting the `autoVerify` attribute to `true`. Specifying `autoVerify` is required for Android App Links to work correctly.

The following example shows a basic configuration that enables your app to appear in the standard Android dialog as an option for handling any links to the `webapp.io` domain. It also uses the regular `https` scheme since [Android App Links](/linking/overview/#android-app-links) are different from [standard deep links](/linking/into-other-apps/).

```json app.json|collapseHeight=454
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "VIEW",
          "autoVerify": true,
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "*.webapp.io",
              "pathPrefix": "/records"
            }
          ],
          "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
        }
      
    }
  }
}
