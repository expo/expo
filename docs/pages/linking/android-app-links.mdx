Android App Links differ from [standard deep links](/linking/into-your-app/), as they use regular HTTP and HTTPS schemes and are exclusive to Android devices. They allow your app to always open when a user clicks a link instead of presenting a dialog for the user to choose between the browser or another handler. If a user doesn't have your app installed, the link takes them to the associated website.

This guide provides steps to configure Android App Links in your project.

## Add `intentFilters` to the app config

To enable Android App Links, configure your [app config](/workflow/configuration/) by adding the `android.intentFilters` property and setting the `autoVerify` attribute to `true`. Specifying `autoVerify` is required for Android App Links to work correctly.

The following code example shows a basic configuration that enables your app to appear in the standard Android dialog as an option for handling any links to the `myapp.io` domain:

```json app.json|collapseHeight=454
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "VIEW",
          /* @info Add the <CODE>autoVerify</CODE> property to the intent filter in app config to enable app links.*/
          "autoVerify": true,
          /* @end */
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "*.myapp.io",
              "pathPrefix": "/records"
            }
          ],
          "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Set up two-way association

You need to set up the **two-way association** between the website and app for Android. This is done in two steps:

- **Website verification:** This requires creating a **assetlinks.json** file inside the **/.well-known** directory and hosting it on the target website. This file is used to verify that the app opened from a given link is the correct app.
- **Native app verification:** This requires some form of code signing that references the target website domain (URL).

After setting up the two-way association, you need to configure the runtime routing for the link in your app. This configuration is done in JavaScript and must be applied to every route, ensuring coordination between web and native platforms. Expo offers a fully automated solution for this using [Expo Router](/router/introduction/).

### Create assetlinks.json file

<Step label="1">

Create an **assetlinks.json** file for the website verification (also known as [digital asset links](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) file) at **/.well-known/assetlinks.json**. This file is used to verify that the app opened for a given link.

If you're using Expo Router to build your website (or any other modern React framework such as Remix, Next.js, and so on), create **assetlinks.json** at **public/.well-known/assetlinks.json**. For legacy Expo webpack projects, create the file at **web/.well-known/assetlinks.json**.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Get the value of `package_name` from your app config under `android.package`.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Get the value of `sha256_cert_fingerprints` from your app's signing certificate. With [EAS Build](/build/setup/):

- Build your Android app
- Run `eas credentials -p android` command, and select the build profile to get its fingerprint value.
- Copy the fingerprint value listed under `SHA256 Fingerprint`.

<Collapsible summary="Alternate method to obtain the SHA256 certificate fingerprint from Google Play Console">

If you're not using EAS to manage code signing, you can find the **sha256_cert_fingerprints** by building and submitting your app manually to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/):

- Inside the Google Play Console's dashboard, go to **Release > Setup > App Signing**.
- Find the correct **Digital Asset Links JSON** snippet for your app.
- Copy the value looks like `14:6D:E9:83...` and paste it into your **public/.well-known/assetlinks.json** file under `sha256_cert_fingerprints`.

</Collapsible>

</Step>

<Step label="4">

Add `package_name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints` to the **assetlinks.json** file:

```json public/.well-known/assetlinks.json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      /* @info Replace <CODE>com.example</CODE> with your app's package name. */
      "package_name": "com.example",
      /* @end */
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        // Supports multiple fingerprints for different apps and keys
        /* @info Replace <CODE>14:6D:E9:83...</CODE> with your app's SHA256 certificate fingerprint. */
        "14:6D:E9:83:51:7F:66:01:84:93:4F:2F:5E:E0:8F:3A:D6:F4:CA:41:1A:CF:45:BF:8D:10:76:76:CD"
        /* @end */
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

> **info** You can add multiple fingerprints to the `sha256_cert_fingerprints` array to support different variants of your app. For more information, see [Android's documentation on Declare website associations](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc).

</Step>

### Host assetlinks.json file

Host the **assetlinks.json** file using a web server with your domain. This file must be served with the content-type `application/json` and accessible over an HTTPS connection. Verify that your browser can access this file.

### Native app verification

Install the app on an Android device to trigger the [Android app verification](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc) process. This process takes at least 20 seconds. Once you have your app opened, see [Handle links into your app](/linking/into-your-app/#handle-urls) for more information on how to handle inbound links and show the user the content they requested.

## Test and debug Android App Links locally

Expo CLI enables you to test Android App Links without deploying a website. Utilizing the [`--tunnel`](/more/expo-cli/#tunneling) functionality, you can forward your dev server to a publicly available HTTPS URL.

<Step label="1">

Set the environment variable `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN=my-custom-domain` where `my-custom-domain` is a unique string that you use during development. This ensures that your tunnel URL is consistent across dev server restarts.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Add `intentFilters` to your app config as [described above](#add-intentfilters-to-app-config). Replace the `host` value with a Ngrok URL: `my-custom-domain.ngrok.io`.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Start your dev server with the `--tunnel` flag:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start --tunnel']} />

</Step>

<Step label="4">

Compile the development build on your device:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo run:android']} />

</Step>

<Step label="5">

You can use the following `adb` command to start the intent activity:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '$ adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW  -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "https://my-custom-domain.ngrok.io/" <your-package-name>',
  ]}
/>

</Step>

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common tips to help you troubleshoot when implementing Android App Links:

- Ensure your website is served over HTTPS and with content-type `application/json`
- [Verify Android app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks)
- Android verification may take at least 20 seconds to take effect
- If you update your web files, rebuild the native app to trigger a server update on the vendor side (Google)
