To configure Android App Links for your app, you need to:

- Add `intentFilters` and set `autoVerify` to true in your project's app config
- Set up two-way association to verify your website and native app

## Add `intentFilters` to the app config

Configure your app config by adding the `android.intentFilters` property and setting the `autoVerify` attribute to `true`. Specifying `autoVerify` is required for Android App Links to work correctly.

The following example shows a basic configuration that enables your app to appear in the standard Android dialog as an option for handling any links to the `webapp.io` domain. It also uses the regular `https` scheme since [Android App Links](/linking/overview/#android-app-links) are different from [standard deep links](/linking/into-other-apps/).

```json app.json|collapseHeight=454
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "VIEW",
          /* @info Add the <CODE>autoVerify</CODE> property to the intent filter in app config to enable app links.*/
          "autoVerify": true,
          /* @end */
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "*.webapp.io",
              "pathPrefix": "/records"
            }
          ],
          "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Set up two-way association

To setup **two-way association** between the website and Android app, you will need the following:

- **Website verification:** This requires creating a **assetlinks.json** file inside the **/.well-known** directory and hosting it on the target website. This file is used to verify that the app opened from a given link is the correct app.
- **Native app verification:** This requires some form of code signing that references the target website domain (URL).

### Create assetlinks.json file

<Step label="1">

Create an **assetlinks.json** file for the website verification (also known as [digital asset links](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) file) at **/.well-known/assetlinks.json**. This file is used to verify that the app opened for a given link.

If you're using Expo Router to build your website (or any other modern React framework such as Remix, Next.js, and so on), create **assetlinks.json** at **public/.well-known/assetlinks.json**. For legacy Expo webpack projects, create the file at **web/.well-known/assetlinks.json**.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Get the value of `package_name` from your app config, under `android.package`.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Get the value of `sha256_cert_fingerprints` from your app's signing certificate. If you're using [EAS Build](/build/setup/) to build your Android app, after creating a build:

- Run `eas credentials -p android` command, and select the build profile to get its fingerprint value.
- Copy the fingerprint value listed under `SHA256 Fingerprint`.

<Collapsible summary="Alternate method to obtain the SHA256 certificate fingerprint from Google Play Console">

If you're not using EAS to manage code signing, you can find the **sha256_cert_fingerprints** by building and submitting your app manually to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/):

- Inside the Google Play Console's dashboard, go to **Release > Setup > App Signing**.
- Find the correct **Digital Asset Links JSON** snippet for your app.
- Copy the value looks like `14:6D:E9:83...` and paste it into your **public/.well-known/assetlinks.json** file under `sha256_cert_fingerprints`.

</Collapsible>

</Step>

<Step label="4">

Add `package_name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints` to the **assetlinks.json** file:

```json public/.well-known/assetlinks.json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      /* @info Replace <CODE>com.example</CODE> with your app's package name. */
      "package_name": "com.example",
      /* @end */
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        // Supports multiple fingerprints for different apps and keys
        /* @info Replace <CODE>14:6D:E9:83...</CODE> with your app's SHA256 certificate fingerprint. */
        "14:6D:E9:83:51:7F:66:01:84:93:4F:2F:5E:E0:8F:3A:D6:F4:CA:41:1A:CF:45:BF:8D:10:76:76:CD"
        /* @end */
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

> **info** You can add multiple fingerprints to the `sha256_cert_fingerprints` array to support different variants of your app. For more information, see [Android's documentation on how to declare website associations](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc).

</Step>

### Host assetlinks.json file

Host the **assetlinks.json** file using a web server with your domain. This file must be served with the content-type `application/json` and accessible over an HTTPS connection. Verify that your browser can access this file by typing the complete URL in the address bar.

### Native app verification

Install the app on an Android device to trigger the [Android app verification](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc) process.

Once you have your app opened, see [Handle links into your app](/linking/into-your-app/#handle-urls) for more information on how to handle inbound links and show the user the content they requested.

## Debugging

The Expo CLI enables you to test Android App Links without deploying a website. Utilizing the [`--tunnel`](/more/expo-cli/#tunneling) functionality, you can forward your dev server to a publicly available HTTPS URL.

<Step label="1">

Set the environment variable `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN=my-custom-domain` where `my-custom-domain` is a unique string that you use during development. This ensures that your tunnel URL is consistent across dev server restarts.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Add `intentFilters` to your app config as [described above](#add-intentfilters-to-the-app-config). Replace the `host` value with a Ngrok URL: `my-custom-domain.ngrok.io`.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Start your dev server with the `--tunnel` flag:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start --tunnel']} />

</Step>

<Step label="4">

Compile the development build on your device:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo run:android']} />

</Step>

<Step label="5">

Use the following `adb` command to start the intent activity and open the link on your app or type the custom domain link in your device's web browser.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '$ adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW  -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "https://my-custom-domain.ngrok.io/" <your-package-name>',
  ]}
/>

</Step>

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common tips to help you troubleshoot when implementing Android App Links:

- Ensure your website is served over HTTPS and with the content-type `application/json`
- [Verify Android app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks)
- Android verification may take 20 seconds or longer to take effect, so be sure to wait until it is completed.
- If you update your web files, rebuild the native app to trigger a server update on the vendor side (Google)
