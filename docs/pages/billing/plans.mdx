[Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) offers [free access](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#commercial-usage) to a limited quantity of low-priority builds on [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) and free updates with [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/). These limits reset monthly.

Beyond the Free plan, there are different subscription plans to cater to various customers and their needs. Each plan offers credits to enable priority builds for EAS Build and broader access to EAS Update through more monthly updated users and extra bandwidth. We also offer add-ons that complement subscriptions and enable opt-in features to amplify customer needs.

This page lists different subscription-based plans and available add-ons.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are billed monthly and are priced the same worldwide (pre-tax). To see your account's current subscribed plan, go to [your account's Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing), and under **Plan**, you will find details of your current plan.

You can also cancel a subscription at any time. See [Cancel a plan](/billing/manage/#cancel-a-plan) for more information.

We also offer annual contracts on an as-needed basis. Contact our [customer support](https://expo.dev/contact) team to see if an annual plan suits you.

## Plans

Each plan has specific limits. However, subscribers can exceed them and pay for additional usage with [usage-based billing](/billing/usage-based-pricing/).

### Production

The Production plan is designed for professional developers and small businesses. Subscribing to this plan gets you access to:

- Reliable, production-grade services
- Monthly [credits](/billing/usage-based-pricing/) for high-priority builds for EAS Build
- More unique users, higher bandwidth, and storage limit for EAS Update

If you exceed the limits or use up your monthly credits, any further usage will be charged at [usage-based prices](/billing/usage-based-pricing/).

### Enterprise

The Enterprise plan is designed for organizations and enterprises that have large projects and require additional resources such as dedicated support. Subscribing to this plan gets you access to:

- Reliable, production-grade services
- Monthly [credits](/billing/usage-based-pricing/) for high-priority builds for EAS Build
- More unique users, higher bandwidth, and storage limit for EAS Update

An Enterprise plan offers much higher monthly credits for EAS Build and bandwidth for EAS Update than any other plan.

If you exceed the limits or use up your monthly credits, any further usage will be charged at [usage-based prices](/billing/usage-based-pricing/).

### On-demand

The On-demand plan is a pay-as-you-go option for developers who have variable usage of our services. You can dial up or down your usage as you see fit and upgrade to the Production or Enterprise plan if needed.

Subscribing to the On-demand plan gets you access to:

- Reliable, production-grade services
- Priority builds with EAS Build at usage-based prices
- The ability to exceed the limits of the Free plan for EAS Update and pay for additional usage

## Usage-based billing

Usage-based billing is applied to customers who exceed their plan limits. It enables you to use our services without worrying about limitations or any contractual obligations.

Usage-based billing is billed monthly and is currently enabled for EAS Build and EAS Update. We provide an estimate of your existing usage and any overage charges on [your account's Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing).

## Add-ons

### Enterprise Support

The Enterprise Support add-on is only available for new Enterprise plan subscribers, subject to availability. Key features include:

- Receiving professional, long-term support from our experts
- Direct communication channel support with a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
- A dedicated account manager
