**Billing** in the Expo dashboard provides information about your account's currently subscribed plan and monthly usage. It also allows you to manage your plan and billing details.

This guide explains how to manage your account's plans and billing information.

## Manage plans

### View the current plan

<Tabs>

<Tab label="For Organization accounts">

- Click [Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing) from the navigation menu under **Organization settings**.
- Under **Plan**, you can see the current plan for your account.

For example, an Organization account is subscribed to the Production plan below:

### Upgrade to a new plan

To upgrade to a different plan:

- Click [Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing) from the navigation menu in Expo dashboard.
- Under **Plan**, click **Change Plan** if you are already on a paid plan. If you are on the Free plan, click **Subscribe**. It opens the **Cart** page.

> **Note**: If you are subscribing to the [On-demand plan](/billing/plans/#on-demand), you are not charged any fee when you check out. Since this is a usage-based plan, all charges are due at the end of the billing period.

### Downgrade a plan

If you are on a Production, Enterprise, or Legacy plan, you can downgrade to the On-demand or Free plan.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="To On-demand plan">

Downgrading to the On-demand plan takes effect after your current billing period ends.

To downgrade, go to [Billing](https://expo.dev/settings/billing) and follow the steps below:
