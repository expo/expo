**EAS Hosting** is a service for quickly deploying the your web projects built using the [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/router/) library. It seamlessly integrates with the Expo CLI, allowing you to automate the deployment of API routes, server functions, and server-side assets.

Hosting supports both static and server mode web projects and offers the fastest path from `npx create-expo-app` to a fully deployed web app with API routes.
