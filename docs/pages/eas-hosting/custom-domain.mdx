By default, your production deployment on EAS Hosting will look like this: `my-app.expo.app` , where `my-app` is your chosen preview subdomain name. If you own a domain, you may assign it as a custom domain to the production deployment.

Each project can have exactly one custom domain, which is assigned to the production deployment.

> **info** **Note**: Setting up a custom domain is a premium feature and isn't available on the free plan. Learn more about different plans and benefits at [EAS pricing](https://expo.dev/pricing).

## Prerequisites

<Collapsible summary="An EAS Hosting project with a production deployment">

The custom domain will always lead to the production deployment. Therefore in order to set this up, you will need a deployment that's been promoted to production.

You will need to own a domain name you want to use.

## Assigning a custom domain

1. In your project's dashboard on expo.dev, navigate to [Hosting Settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[accountName]/projects/[projectName]/hosting/settings).
2. If you do not have a production deployment, you'll be prompted create one first.
3. Under **Custom domain**, enter the custom domain to route your project to. Both apex domains and subdomains are supported, so if you own `example.com`, you can select:

   - `example.com`: apex domain
   - `anything.example.com`: a subdomain

4. Now you'll be prompted to fill out some DNS records with your DNS provider:

   - **Verification**: This proves you own the domain
   - **SSL**: Setting up SSL certificates for HTTPS traffic
   - **CNAME** (subdomains)/**A-record** (apex domains): To switch over the domain to point to your production deployment

5. Press the refresh button until all steps have turned green. Depending on your DNS provider, this usually takes a couple of minutes.

> If you require for the domain name switchover to be **zero downtime**, it's important to fill out these records one by one in the order they are presented in the table.
> That is, add the **TXT** record for verification, press the refresh button until the UI says verification is successful, then proceed to the next one.
> If downtime isn't important or relevant, you may add all three DNS records at once.

After assigning a custom domain to your app, the custom domain will route to your **production** deployment.
