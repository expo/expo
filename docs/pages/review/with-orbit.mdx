[Expo Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit) is a macOS and Windows app designed to speed up installing and running builds from EAS. It makes running your builds and updates as easy as pressing **Open in Orbit**.

<Collapsible summary="How does automatic installation and launching of updates work?">

When you launch an update, Orbit will look for the latest development build that matches the runtime version and target platform of the update. If a compatible build is found, the update will install automatically on the target device and launch with a deep link that points to the update.

If you don't have any development builds available, either because they have all expired, you haven't created one, you don't use EAS Build, or you are [building your app locally](/guides/local-app-development/), then Orbit will prompt you on how to proceed. Click **Launch with deep link** in the prompt to open the update if you already have a compatible development build installed on your target device.

Previewing with Expo Orbit requires you to have an update published. If you haven't published an update, see [Publish an update](/eas-update/getting-started/#publish-an-update) before following the steps in the next section.

### Install and launch the update

> **Note**: Launching updates using Expo Orbit is not supported on physical iOS devices. It is supported on Android devices/emulators or iOS Simulators.

After the update is published, follow these steps to open it on an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator:

- Navigate your project's **Updates** tab.
- Select the update you want to preview.
- Click **Preview**. This will open the **Preview** dialog.
- Under **Open with Orbit**, select a platform to launch the update.
- Orbit will install and launch the update on the selected Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

You can now seamlessly launch and review updates using Expo Orbit.
