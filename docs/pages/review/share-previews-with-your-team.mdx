Once you've made changes on a branch, you can share them with your team by publishing an update. This allows you to get feedback on your changes during review.

The following steps will outline a basic flow for publishing a preview of your changes, and then sharing it with your team. For a more comprehensive resource, see the [Preview updates](/eas-update/preview/) guide.

## Publish a preview of your changes

You can publish a preview of your current changes by running the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --auto']} />

This command will publish an update under the current branch name.

## Share with your team

Once the preview is published, you'll see output like this in the terminal window:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '✔ Published!',
    '',
    '...',
    'EAS Dashboard      https://expo.dev/accounts/your-account/projects/your-project/updates/708b05d8-9bcf-4212-a052-ce40583b04fd',
  ]}
/>

Share the **EAS dashboard** link with a reviewer. After opening the link, they can click on the **Preview** button. They will see a QR code that they can scan to open the preview on their device.

/>

## Create previews automatically

You can automatically create previews on every commit with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/). First, you'll need to [configure your project](/eas/workflows/get-started/#configure-your-project), add a file named **.eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml** at the root of your project, then add the following workflow configuration:

```yaml .eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml
name: Publish preview update

on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']

jobs:
  publish_preview_update:
    name: Publish preview update
    type: update
    params:
      branch: ${{ github.ref_name || 'test' }}
```

The workflow above will publish an update on every commit to every branch. You can also run this workflow manually with the following EAS CLI command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run publish-preview-update.yml']} />

Learn more about common patterns with the [workflows examples guide](/eas/workflows/examples).
