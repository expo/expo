Once you've made changes on a branch, you can share them with your team by publishing an update. This allows you to get feedback on your changes during review.

## Publish a preview of your changes

You can publish a preview of your current changes by running the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --auto']} />

This command will publish an update under the current branch name.

## Share with your team

Once the preview is published, you'll see output like this in the terminal window:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    'âœ” Published!',
    '',
    '...',
    'EAS Dashboard      https://expo.dev/accounts/your-account/projects/your-project/updates/708b05d8-9bcf-4212-a052-ce40583b04fd',
  ]}
/>

Share the **EAS dashboard** link with a reviewer. After opening the link, they can click on the **Preview** button. They will see a QR code that they can scan to open the preview on their device.
