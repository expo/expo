To set up EAS Build with a monorepo, you need to follow the standard process as described below:

- Run all EAS CLI commands from the root of the app directory. For example, if your project exists inside your git repository at **apps/my-app**, then run `eas build` from there.
- All files related to EAS, such as **eas.json**, **credentials.json**, and the **.eas/workflows** directory, should be in the root of the app directory. If you have multiple apps in your monorepo, each app directory will have its own copy of these files.
- **If you are building a managed project in a monorepo**, see [Working with Monorepos](/guides/monorepos) guide.
- If your project needs additional setup beyond what is provided, add a `postinstall` step to **package.json** in your project that builds all necessary dependencies in other workspaces. For example:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "cd ../.. && yarn build"
  }
}
```

## Using EAS Workflows with monorepos

When you connect a GitHub repository to your Expo project, you can set a base directory that points to your app directory (for example, **apps/my-app**). This allows [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/introduction/) to trigger builds and other automated tasks for that specific app.

The **.eas/workflows** directory lives in the same directory as **eas.json**, so each app in your monorepo can have its own workflows.
