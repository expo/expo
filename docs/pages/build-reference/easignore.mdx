A `.easignore` file specifies files that should be intentionally ignored by [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) when uploading your project to the [EAS Build](/build/introduction) servers.

> **info** Ignoring unnecessary files can help reduce your app's archive size and the time it takes to upload.

By default, the [EAS CLI](/build/setup/#install-the-latest-eas-cli) uses the [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file (if present) to determine which files to ignore. However, if you create a `.easignore` file, the EAS CLI will prioritize it over the `.gitignore` file. When using a `.easignore` file, include all files from your `.gitignore` file in your `.easignore` file; from there, you can add additional files as needed.

## Getting started with .easignore

<Step label="1">

Create a `.easignore` file in the root of your project.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Copy the content of the `.gitignore` file into the `.easignore` file and extend it with the files not neccessary for the build process.

```bash .easignore
# Copy everything from your .gitignore file here

# Additional ignores specific to EAS builds

# Ignore native folders (EAS handles these)
/ios
/android

# Ignore test coverage reports
/coverage
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Save the file and trigger a new build.

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --profile development']} />

</Step>
