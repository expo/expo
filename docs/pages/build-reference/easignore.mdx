A **.easignore** file defines which files [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) should ignore when uploading your project to the [EAS Build](/build/introduction) servers.

> **info** Ignoring unnecessary files can help reduce your app's archive size and upload time.

By default, the [EAS CLI](/build/setup/#install-the-latest-eas-cli) refers to the [**.gitignore**](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file (if it exists) to determine which files to ignore. If you create a **.easignore** file, the EAS CLI prioritizes it over the **.gitignore** file. When creating a **.easignore** file, include all files and directories from your **.gitignore** file and add additional files you want to ignore.

<Step label="1">

Create a **.easignore** file in the root of your project.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Copy the content of the **.gitignore** file into the **.easignore** file. Then, add any files that are unnecessary for the build process.

```bash .easignore
# Copy everything from your .gitignore file here

# Additional ignores specific to EAS builds

# Ignore native folders (if you are using EAS Build)
/android
/ios

# Ignore test coverage reports
/coverage
```

If your project does not contain **android** and **ios** directories, [EAS Build will run Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build) to generate these native directories before compilation.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Save the file and trigger a new build.

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --profile development']} />

</Step>

You've successfully configured your **.easignore** file.
