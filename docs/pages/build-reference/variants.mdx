When creating [development, preview, and production builds](/build/eas-json/#common-use-cases), installing these build variants simultaneously on the same device is common. This allows working in development, previewing the next version of the app, and running the production version on a device without needing to uninstall and reinstall the app.

This guide provides the steps required to configure multiple (development and production) variants to install and use them on the same device.

## Prerequisites

To have multiple variants of an app installed on your device, each variant must have a unique [Application ID (Android)](/versions/latest/config/app/#package) or [Bundle Identifier (iOS)](/versions/latest/config/app/#bundleidentifier).

## Configure development and production variants


You've created a project using Expo tooling, and now you want to create a development and a production build. Your project's **app.json** may have the following configuration:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.myapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.myapp"
    }
  }
}
```

If your project has EAS Build configured, the **eas.json** also has a similar configuration as shown below:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

### Convert app.json to app.config.js

To have multiple variants of the app installed on the same device, rename the **app.json** to **app.config.js** and export the configuration as shown below:

```js app.config.js
export default {
  name: 'MyApp',
  slug: 'my-app',
  ios: {
    bundleIdentifier: 'com.myapp',
  },
  android: {
    package: 'com.myapp',
  },
};
```

In **app.config.js**, add an environment variable called `IS_DEV` to switch the `android.package` and `ios.bundleIdentifier` for each variant based on the variable:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js app.config.js
const IS_DEV = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'development';

export default {
  /* @info You can also switch out the app icon and other properties to further differentiate the app on your device. */
  name: IS_DEV ? 'MyApp (Dev)' : 'MyApp',
  /* @end */
  slug: 'my-app',
  ios: {
    bundleIdentifier: IS_DEV ? 'com.myapp.dev' : 'com.myapp',
  },
  android: {
    package: IS_DEV ? 'com.myapp.dev' : 'com.myapp',
  },
};
```

In the above example, the environment variable `IS_DEV` is used to differentiate between the development and production environment. Based on its value, the different Application IDs or Bundle Identifiers are set for each variant.

> **Note**: If you are using any libraries that require you to register your application identifier with an external service to use the SDK, such as Google Maps, you'll need to have a separate configuration for that API for the `android.package` and `ios.bundleIdentifier`. You can also swap this configuration using the same approach as above.

### Configuration for EAS Build

In **eas.json**, set the `APP_VARIANT` environment variable to run builds with the **development** profile by using the `env` property:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "env": {
        "APP_VARIANT": "development"
      }
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

Now, when you run `eas build --profile development`, the environment variable `APP_VARIANT` is set to `development` when evaluating **app.config.js** both locally and on the EAS Build builder.

### Using the development server

When you start your development server, you'll need to run `APP_VARIANT=development npx expo start` (or the platform equivalent if you use Windows).

A shortcut for this is to add the following script to your **package.json**:

```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "APP_VARIANT=development npx expo start"
  }
}
```

### Using production variant

When you run `eas build --profile production` the `APP_VARIANT` variable environment is not set, and the build runs as the production variant.

> **Note**: If you use EAS Update to publish JavaScript updates of your app, you should be cautious to set the correct environment variables for the app variant that you are publishing for when you run the `eas update` command. See the EAS Build [Environment variables and secrets](/build/updates) for more information.

### In bare project

#### Android

In **android/app/build.gradle**, create a separate flavor for every build profile from **eas.json** that you want to build.

```groovy android/app/build.gradle
android {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    flavorDimensions "env"
    productFlavors {
        production {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId 'com.myapp'
        }
        development {
            dimension "env"
            applicationId 'com.myapp.dev'
        }
    }
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

> **Note**: Currently, EAS CLI supports only the `applicationId` field. If you use `applicationIdSuffix` inside `productFlavors` or `buildTypes` sections then this value will not be detected correctly.

Assign Android flavors to EAS build profiles by specifying a `gradleCommand` in the **eas.json**:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDevelopmentDebug"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:bundleProductionRelease"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, every flavor can be built in either debug or release mode. If you want to restrict some flavor to a specific mode, see the snippet below, and modify **build.gradle**.

```groovy android/app/build.gradle
android {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    variantFilter { variant ->
        def validVariants = [
                ["production", "release"],
                ["development", "debug"],
        ]
        def buildTypeName = variant.buildType*.name
        def flavorName = variant.flavors*.name

        def isValid = validVariants.any { flavorName.contains(it[0]) && buildTypeName.contains(it[1]) }
        if (!isValid) {
            setIgnore(true)
        }
    }
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

The rest of the configuration at this point is not specific to EAS, it's the same as it would be for any Android project with flavors. There are a few common configurations that you might want to apply to your project:

- To change the name of the app built with the development profile, create a **android/app/src/development/res/value/strings.xml** file:
  ```xml android/app/src/development/res/value/strings.xml
  <resources>
      <string name="app_name">MyApp - Dev</string>
  </resources>
  ```
- To change the icon of the app built with the development profile, create `android/app/src/development/res/mipmap-*` directories with appropriate assets (you can copy them from **android/app/src/main/res** and replace the icon files).
- To specify **google-services.json** for a specific flavor, put it in the **android/app/src/&lbrace;flavor&rbrace;/google-services.json** file.
- To configure sentry, add `project.ext.sentryCli = [ flavorAware: true ]` to **android/app/build.gradle** and name your properties file `android/sentry-{flavor}-{buildType}.properties` (for example, **android/sentry-production-release.properties**)

#### iOS

Assign a different `scheme` to every build profile in **eas.json**:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug",
        "scheme": "myapp-dev"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Release",
        "scheme": "myapp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Podfile** should have a target defined like this:

```ruby Podfile
target 'myapp' do
  # @hide ... #
  # @end #
end
```

Replace it with an abstract target, where the common configuration can be copied from the old target:

```ruby Podfile
abstract_target 'common' do
  # put common target configuration here

  target 'myapp' do
  end

  target 'myapp-dev' do
  end
end
```

Open project in Xcode, click on the project name in the navigation panel, right click on the existing target, and click "Duplicate":

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Duplicate Xcode target"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/variants/1-ios-duplicate-target.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

Rename the target to something more meaningful, for example, `myapp copy` -> `myapp-dev`.

Configure a scheme for the new target:

- Go to `Product` -> `Scheme` -> `Manage schemes`.
- Find scheme `myapp copy` on the list.
- Change scheme name `myapp copy` -> `myapp-dev`.
- By default, the new scheme should be marked as shared, but Xcode does not create `.xcscheme` files. To fix that, uncheck the "Shared" checkbox and check it again, after that new `.xcscheme` file should show up in the **ios/myapp.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes** directory.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Xcode scheme list"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/variants/2-scheme-list.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

By default, the newly created target has separate **Info.plist** file (in the above example, it's **ios/myapp copy-Info.plist**). To simplify your project we recommend using the same file for all targets:

- Delete **./ios/myapp copy-Info.plist**.
- Click on the new target.
- Go to `Build Settings` tab.
- Find `Packaging` section.
- Change **Info.plist** value - **myapp copy-Info.plist** -> **myapp/Info.plist**.
- Change `Product Bundle Identifier`.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="Xcode build settings"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/variants/3-target-build-settings.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

To change the display name:

- Open **Info.plist** and add key `Bundle display name` with value `$(DISPLAY_NAME)`.
- Open `Build Settings` for both targets and find `User-Defined` section.
- Add key `DISPLAY_NAME` with the name you want to use for that target.

To change the app icon:

- Create a new image set (you can create it from the existing image set for the current icon, it's usually named `AppIcon`)
- Open `Build Settings` for the target that you want to change icon.
- Find `Asset Catalog Compiler - Options` section.
- Change `Primary App Icon Set Name` to the name of the new image set.
