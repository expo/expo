In this guide, you will learn what happens when EAS CLI configures your project with `eas build:configure` (or `eas build` - which runs this same process if the project is not yet configured).

EAS CLI performs the following steps when configuring your project:

#### 1. Ask you about the platform(s) to configure

If you only want to use EAS Build for a single platform, that's fine. If you change your mind, you can come back and configure the other later.

<ImageSpotlight alt="Terminal running eas build command with platform iOS and Android options available" src="/static/images/eas-build/configure/01-configure-platform.png" containerStyle={{ paddingBottom: 0 }} />

#### 2. Create eas.json

The command will create an **eas.json** file in the root directory with the default configuration. It looks something like this:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

If you have a bare project, it will look a bit different.

This is your EAS Build configuration. It defines three build profiles named `development`, `preview`, and `production` (you can have multiple build profiles like `production`, `debug`, `testing`, etc.) for each platform. If you want to learn more about **eas.json** see the [Configuration with eas.json](/build/eas-json.mdx) page.

#### 3. Configure the project

This step varies depending on the project type you have.

#### 3.1. Managed project

If you haven't configured your **app.json** with `android.package` and/or `ios.bundleIdentifier` yet, EAS CLI will prompt you to specify them.

- `android.package` will be used as the Android application id which is used to identify your app on the Google Play Store
- `ios.bundleIdentifier` will be used to identify you app on the Apple App Store

In the example above, we defined exactly the same Android application id and iOS bundle identifier. However, they don't need to match.

#### 3.2. Bare project

There are no additional steps for bare workflow projects.

#### 4. Next steps

That's all there is to configuring a project to be compatible with EAS Build.
There is one final step if you set `cli.requireCommit` to `true` in your **eas.json** — you'll be prompted to commit all the changes we made for you. You can choose to review them before committing, and you can either specify the git commit message or use a default message.
