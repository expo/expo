In this guide, you will learn what happens when EAS CLI configures your project with `eas build:configure` (or `eas build` - which runs this same process if the project is not yet configured).

EAS CLI performs the following steps when configuring your project:

<Step label="1">
## Ask you about the platform(s) to configure

If you only want to use EAS Build for a single platform, that's fine. If you change your mind, you can come back and configure the other later.

/>

</Step>

<Step label="2">
## Create eas.json

The command will create an **eas.json** file in the root directory with the default configuration. It looks something like this:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

If you have a bare project, it will look a bit different.

This is your EAS Build configuration. It defines three build profiles named `"development"`, `"preview"`, and `"production"` (you can have multiple build profiles like `"production"`, `"debug"`, `"testing"`, and so on) for each platform. If you want to learn more about **eas.json** see the [Configuration with **eas.json**](/build/eas-json) page.

</Step>

<Step label="3">
## Configure the project

This step varies depending on the project type you have.

<Step label="3.1">
### Managed project

If you haven't configured your **app.json** with `android.package` and/or `ios.bundleIdentifier` yet, EAS CLI will prompt you to specify them.

- `android.package` will be used as the Android application id which is used to identify your app on the Google Play Store
- `ios.bundleIdentifier` will be used to identify you app on the Apple App Store

  containerStyle={{ paddingBottom: 0 }}
/>

In the example above, we defined exactly the same Android application id and iOS bundle identifier. However, they don't need to match.

</Step>

<Step label="3.2">
### Bare project

There are no additional steps for bare workflow projects.

</Step>

</Step>

<Step label="4">
## Next steps

That's all there is to configuring a project to be compatible with EAS Build.
There is one final step if you set `cli.requireCommit` to `true` in your **eas.json** â€” you'll be prompted to commit all the changes we made for you. You can choose to review them before committing, and you can either specify the git commit message or use a default message.
