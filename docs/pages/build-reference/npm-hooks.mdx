title: Build lifecycle hooks
description: Learn how to use the EAS Build lifecycle hooks with npm to customize your build process.
---

There are five EAS Build lifecycle npm hooks that you can set in your **package.json**. See the [Android build process](android-builds.mdx) and [iOS build process](ios-builds.mdx) docs to get a better understanding about the internals of the build process.

- `eas-build-pre-install` - executed before EAS Build runs `npm install`.
- `eas-build-post-install` - the behavior depends on the platform and project type:
  - Android - runs once after the following commands have all completed: `npm install` and `npx expo prebuild` (if needed)
  - iOS - runs once after the following commands have all completed: `npm install`, `npx expo prebuild` (if needed), and `pod install`.
- `eas-build-on-success` - this hook is triggered at the end of the build process if the build was successful.
- `eas-build-on-error` - this hook is triggered at the end of the build process if the build failed.
- `eas-build-on-complete` - this hook is triggered at the end of the build process. You can check the build's status with the `EAS_BUILD_STATUS` environment variable. It's either `finished` or `errored`.
- `eas-build-on-cancel` - this hook is triggered if the build is canceled.

Below is an example of how your **package.json** can look with lifecycle hooks:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "echo 123",
    "eas-build-post-install": "echo 456",
    "eas-build-on-success": "echo 789",
    "eas-build-on-error": "echo 012",
    "eas-build-on-cancel": "echo 345",
    "start": "expo start",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~46.0.0"
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Platform-specific hook behavior

If you would like to run a script (or some part of a script) only for iOS builds or only for Android builds, you can fork the behavior depending on the platform within the script. See examples for common ways to do this through a shell script or a Node script below.

## Examples

### `package.json` and shell script

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "./pre-install",
    "start": "expo start"
    // ...
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

```bash pre-install
#!/bin/bash

# This is a file called "pre-install" in the root of the project

if [[ "$EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM" == "android" ]]; then
  echo "Run commands for Android builds here"
elif [[ "$EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM" == "ios" ]]; then
  echo "Run commands for iOS builds here"
fi
```

### `package.json` and Node script

```json package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "node pre-install.js",
    "start": "expo start"
    // ...
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

```js pre-install.js
// This is a file called "pre-install.js" in the root of the project

if (process.env.EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM === 'android') {
  console.log('Run commands for Android builds here');
} else if (process.env.EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM === 'ios') {
  console.log('Run commands for iOS builds here');
}
```
