When you make a change to your iOS entitlements, this change needs to be updated remotely on Apple's servers before making a production build. EAS Build automatically synchronizes capabilities on the Apple Developer Console with your local entitlements configuration when you run `eas build`. Capabilities are web services provided by Apple, think of them like AWS or Firebase services.

> This feature can be disabled with `EXPO_NO_CAPABILITY_SYNC=1 eas build`

## Entitlements

In bare workflow apps, the entitlements are read from your `ios/**/*.entitlements` file.

In managed workflow, the entitlements are read from the introspected Expo config. You can see what your introspected config looks like by running `npx expo config --type introspect` in your project, then look for the `ios.entitlements` object for the results.

## Enabling

If a supported entitlement is present in the entitlements file, then running `eas build` will enable it on Apple Developer Console. If the capability is already enabled, then EAS Build will skip it.

## Disabling

If a capability is enabled for your app remotely, but not present in the native entitlements file, then running `eas build` will automatically disable it.

## Supported Capabilities

EAS Build will only enable capabilities that it has built-in support for, any unsupported entitlements must be manually enabled via [Apple Developer Console][apple-dev-console].

The unsupported capabilities either don't support iOS, or they don't have a corresponding entitlement value. Here are all of the [official Apple capabilities][apple-all-capabilities].

## Capability identifiers

Merchant IDs, App Groups, and CloudKit Containers can all be automatically registered and assigned to your app. These assignments require Apple cookies authentication (running locally) as the official App Store Connect API does not support these operations.

## Debugging

You can run `EXPO_DEBUG=1 eas build` to get more detailed logs regarding the capability syncing.

If you have trouble using this feature, you can disable it with the environment variable `EXPO_NO_CAPABILITY_SYNC=1`.

To see all of the currently enabled capabilities, visit [Apple Developer Console][apple-dev-console], and find the bundle identifier matching your app, if you click on it you should see a list of all the currently enabled capabilities.

## Manual setup

There are two ways to manually enable Apple capabilities, both systems will require any existing Apple provisioning profiles to be regenerated.

### Xcode

> Preferred method for bare workflow or projects that do **not** using [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) to continuously generate the native `ios` and `android` directories.

1. Open the `ios/` directory in Xcode with `xed ios`. If you don't have an `ios/` directory, run `npx expo prebuild -p ios` to generate one.
2. Then follow [this guide][apple-enable-capability].

### Apple Developer Console

First step is to add the respective key/value pairs to your `ios/[app]/[app].entitlements` (or more specific entitlements file for multi-target apps). You can refer to [Supported Capabilities](#supported-capabilities) to determine which entitlements keys should be added.

1. Log into [Apple Developer Console][apple-dev-console]. Click on "Certificates, IDs & Profiles", then navigate to "Identifiers" page.
2. Choose the bundle identifier that matches your app's bundle identifier.
3. Scroll down and enable a capability, some capabilities may require extra setup.
4. Scroll to the top and press "Save". You will see a dialog that says "Modify App Capabilities", press "Confirm" to continue. You will need to regenerate any provisioning profiles that use this bundle identifier before they'll be valid for building a code signed production ipa.

If adding capabilities process has not been done correctly then your iOS native build will fail with an error that looks something like:

```
❌  error: Provisioning profile "*[expo] app.bacon.hello AppStore ..." doesn't support the Associated Domains capability.

❌  error: Provisioning profile "*[expo] app.bacon.hello AppStore ..." doesn't include the com.apple.developer.associated-domains entitlement.
```
