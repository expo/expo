import { ContentSpotlight } from '~/ui/components/ContentSpotlight';

EAS Build has full support for using private npm packages in your project. These can either be published to npm (if you have [the Pro/Teams plan](https://www.npmjs.com/products)) or to a private registry (for example, using self-hosted [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/)).

Before starting the build, you will need to configure your project to provide EAS Build with your npm token.

## Default npm configuration

By default, EAS Build uses a self-hosted npm cache that speeds up installing dependencies for all builds. Every EAS Build builder is configured with a **.npmrc** file for each platform:

### Android

```ini
registry=http://npm-cache-service.worker-infra-production.svc.cluster.local:4873
```

### iOS

```ini
registry=http://10.254.24.8:4873
```

## Private packages published to npm

If your project is using private packages published to npm, you need to provide EAS Build with [a read-only npm token](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-access-tokens) so that it can install your dependencies successfully.

The recommended way is to add the `NPM_TOKEN` secret to your account or project's secrets:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Secret creation UI filled."
  src="/static/images/eas-build/environment-secrets/secrets-create-filled.png"
/>

For more information on how to do that, see [secret environment variables](/build-reference/variables/#secrets-on-the-expo-website).

When EAS detects that the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable is available during a build, it automatically creates the following **.npmrc**:

```ini .npmrc
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

However, this only happens when **.npmrc** is not in your project's root directory. If you already have this file, you need to update it manually.

You can verify if it worked by viewing build logs and looking for the **Prepare project** build phase:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt=".npmrc created and shown in the build logs."
  src="/static/images/eas-build/npmrc.png"
/>

## Packages published to a private registry

If you're using a private npm registry such as self-hosted [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/), you will need to configure the **.npmrc** manually.

Create a **.npmrc** file in your project's root directory with the following contents:

```ini .npmrc
registry=__REPLACE_WITH_REGISTRY_URL__
```

If your registry requires authentication, you will need to provide the token. For example, if your registry URL is `https://registry.johndoe.com/`, then update the file with:

```ini .npmrc
//registry.johndoe.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
registry=https://registry.johndoe.com/
```

## Both private npm packages and private registry

> This is an advanced example.

Private npm packages are always [scoped](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes#scopes-and-package-visibility). For example, if your npm username is `johndoe`, the private self-hosted registry URL is `https://registry.johndoe.com/`. If you want to install dependencies from both sources, create a **.npmrc** in your project's root directory with the following:

```ini .npmrc
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
@johndoe:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
registry=https://registry.johndoe.com/
```

## Submodules in private repositories

If you have a submodule in a private repository, you will need to initialize it by setting up an SSH key. For more information, see [submodules initialization](/build-reference/git-submodules/#submodules-initialization).

## Packages from a private GitHub repository

If you or your organisation have packages that reference a private GitHub repository then you will need to ensure EAS Build can access this by performing the following setup:

<Step label="1">

Generate a [fine-grained personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with content read permissions for your user/organisation specific repositories you are wanting to install from

</Step>

<Step label="2">

On the Expo Dashboard [add a secret](/build-reference/variables/#using-secrets-in-environment-variables) called `GITHUB_PAT` and set the token you generated as the value

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Add an [`eas-build-pre-install` npm hook](/build-reference/npm-hooks/) to use the PAT in your GitHub requests:

```bash eas-build-pre-install.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/".insteadOf ssh://git@github.com/
```

</Step>
