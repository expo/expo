[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) is a stability monitoring solution that provides rich, end-to-end error reporting and analytics to reproduce and fix errors with speed and precision.
Bugsnag supports the full stack with open-source libraries for [50 and more platforms](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms), including [React Native](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/react-native/).

With Bugsnag, developers and engineering organizations can:

- **Stabilize:** Innovate faster by knowing when to build new features vs. fix bugs. Use the release health dashboard, stability scores and targets, built-in alerts via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more.

- **Prioritize:** Improve customer experience by identifying and prioritizing bugs that have the greatest impact on app stability. Analyze issues grouped by root cause and sorted by the business impact, customer segmentation, A/B testing and experiments results.

- **Fix:** Increase productivity by spending less time on reproducing and fixing bugs. Utilize powerful diagnostic data, full stacktraces and automatic breadcrumbs.

**To add Bugsnag to your Expo project** and automatically capture and report JavaScript errors, follow the integration guide in their documentation:
