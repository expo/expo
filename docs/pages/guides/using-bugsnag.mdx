[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) is a stability monitoring solution that provides rich, end-to-end error reporting and analytics to reproduce and fix errors with speed and precision.
Bugsnag supports the full stack with open-source libraries for [50+ platforms](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms), including [React Native](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/react-native/).

With Bugsnag, developers and engineering organizations can:

- **Stabilize:** Innovate faster by knowing when to build new features vs. fix bugs.

  Use release health dashboard, stability scores and targets, built-in alerts via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more.

- **Prioritize:** Improve customer experience by identifying and prioritizing bugs that have the greatest impact on app stability.

  Analyze issues grouped by root cause and sorted by business impact, customer segmentation, A/B testing and experiments results.

- **Fix:** Increase productivity by spending less time on reproducing and fixing bugs.

  Utilize powerful diagnostic data, full stacktraces and automatic breadcrumbs.

## Get Started

Add Bugsnag to your Expo apps to automatically capture and report JavaScript errors.
Follow the guide below and read the [blog post](https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/build-apps-in-expo-with-bugsnag) announcing Bugsnag’s Expo integration.
If you’re new to Bugsnag, you can [create an account](https://app.bugsnag.com/user/new/) or [request a demo](https://www.bugsnag.com/demo-request).

## Installation and configuration

The easiest way to add Bugsnag to your Expo project is to use our CLI. Alternatively you can follow the [manual setup guide](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/expo/manual-setup).

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx bugsnag-expo-cli init']} />

This will install the [`@bugsnag/expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bugsnag/expo) notifier, add some configuration to **app.json** and initialize Bugsnag in your application.

### Capturing React render errors

An [error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) component is included which you can use to wrap your application. When render errors happen, they will be reported to Bugsnag along with any React-specific info that was available at the time.

To catch all render errors in your application and show a custom error screen to your users, follow this example:

```jsx App.jsx
const ErrorBoundary = Bugsnag.getPlugin('react');

export default () => (
  <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorView}>
    <App />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);

class App extends React.Component {
  // Your main app component
}

class ErrorView extends React.Component {
  // This component will be displayed when an error boundary catches an error
}
```

See [React’s documentation on Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to find out more.

### TypeScript support

Type definitions are provided and will be picked up automatically by the TypeScript compiler when you import `@bugsnag/expo`.
