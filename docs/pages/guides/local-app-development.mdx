To build your project into an app locally using your machine, you have to manually generate native code before testing the debug build or creating a production build for it to submit to the app store. There are two ways you can build your app locally. This guide provides a brief introduction to both methods and references to other guides that are necessary to create this workflow.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps described in this guide, see the instructions below on how to set your development environment.

<Collapsible summary="Android">

<Tabs>

<Tab label='macOS'>

To set up your development environment on macOS for Android, you will install Node.js, Watchman, JDK, and Android Studio.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install the LTS release of Node.js using a [version management tool](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) such as `nvm` or `volta`. If you have already installed Node.js on your system, make sure the version is 16 or above.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

[Install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#macos) using a tool such as Homebrew:

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install watchman']} />

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using Homebrew. This distribution offers JDKs for both M1 and Intel Macs.

We recommend JDK 11 (you may encounter problems with higher JDK versions). Run the following commands in a terminal window to install it:

<Terminal
  cmd={['$ brew tap homebrew/cask-versions', '$ brew install --cask zulu11']}
  cmdCopy="brew tap homebrew/cask-versions && brew install --cask zulu11"
/>

After you install the JDK, add the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in **~/.bash_profile** (or **~/.zshrc** if you use Zsh):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home
```

</Step>

#### Install and configure Android Studio

Android Studio allows installing Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device. They are required to set up the Android development environment. Follow the [instructions on the Android Studio Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to install these tools.

</Tab>

<Tab label='Windows'>

To set up your development environment on Windows for Android, you will install Node.js, JDK, and Android Studio.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install the LTS version of Node.js using Chocolatey:

<Terminal cmd={['$ choco install -y nodejs']} />

If you have already installed Node.js on your system, make sure the version is 16 or above. If you want to be able to switch between different versions, you might want to install Node.js using a version manager such as [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Install [Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/):

<Terminal cmd={['$ choco install -y microsoft-openjdk11']} />

If you already have JDK installed on your system, we recommend JDK11.

</Step>

#### Install and configure Android Studio

Android Studio allows installing Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device. They are required to set up the Android development environment. Follow the [instructions on the Android Studio Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to install these tools.

</Tab>

<Tab label="Linux">

To set up your development environment on Linux for Android, you will install Node.js, Watchman, JDK, and Android Studio.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install Node.js 16 or above by following [installation instructions for your Linux distribution](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

</Step>

<Step label="2">

Follow [installation instructions from the Watchman installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#linux) to compile and install it from the source.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 11. You can download and install [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or your system packager.

<Terminal cmd={['$ choco install -y microsoft-openjdk11']} />

If you already have JDK installed on your system, we recommend JDK11.

</Step>

#### Install and configure Android Studio

Android Studio allows installing Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device. They are required to set up the Android development environment. Follow the [instructions on the Android Studio Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to install these tools.

<Collapsible summary="iOS">

> **warning** A macOS is required to build projects with native code for iOS. You can create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to install the build on an iOS device.

To set up your development environment on macOS for iOS, you'll need to install Node.js, Watchman, Xcode, and CocoaPods.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install the LTS release of Node.js using a [version management tool](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) such as `nvm` or `volta`. If you have already installed Node.js on your system, make sure the version is 16 or above.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

[Install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#macos) using a tool such as Homebrew:

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install watchman']} />

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install Xcode using the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). This tool will also install the iOS Simulator. You will also need to [install Command Line Tools](/workflow/ios-simulator/#install-xcode-command-line-tools).

</Step>

<Step label="4">

[Install CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). You can install using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest macOS version.

## Local app compilation

To build your project locally you can use compile commands from Expo CLI which generates the **android** and **ios** directories:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '# Build native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
/>

The above commands compile your project, using your locally installed Android SDK or Xcode, into a debug build of your app.

- These compilation commands initially run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native directories (**android** and **ios**) before building, if they do not exist yet. If they already exist, this will be skipped.
- You can also add the `--device` flag to select a device to run the app on â€” you can select a physically connected device or emulator/simulator.
- You can pass in `--variant release` (Android) or `--configuration Release` (iOS) to build a [production version of your app](/deploy/build-project/#production-builds-locally).

To modify your project's configuration or native code after the first build, you will have to rebuild your project. Running `npx expo prebuild` again layers the changes on top of existing files. It may also produce different results after the build.

To avoid this, add native directories to the project's **.gitignore** and use `npx expo prebuild --clean` command. This ensures that the project is always managed, and the [`--clean` flag](/workflow/prebuild/#clean) will delete existing directories before regenerating them. You can use [app config](/workflow/configuration/) or create a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) to modify your project's configuration or code inside the native directories.

To learn more about how compilation and prebuild works, see the following guides:

## Local builds with `expo-dev-client`

If you install [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-expo-dev-client) to your project, then a debug build of your project will include the `expo-dev-client` UI and tooling, and we call these development builds.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

To create a development build, you can use [local app compilation](#local-app-compilation) commands (`npx expo run:[android|ios]`) which will create a debug build and start the development server.
