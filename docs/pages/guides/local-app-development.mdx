To build your project into an app locally using your machine, you have to manually generate native code before testing the debug build or creating a production build for it to submit to the app store. There are two ways you can build your app locally. This guide provides a brief introduction to both methods and references to other guides that are necessary to create this workflow.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps described in this guide, see the instructions below on how to set your development environment.

<Collapsible summary="Android">

<Tabs>

<Tab label='macOS'>

To set up your development environment on macOS for Android, you will install Node.js, Watchman, JDK, and Android Studio.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install the LTS release of Node.js using a [version management tool](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) such as `nvm` or `volta`.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

[Install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#macos) using a tool such as Homebrew:

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install watchman']} />

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using Homebrew. This distribution offers JDKs for both M1 and Intel Macs.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="SDK 50 and above">

We recommend JDK 17. Run the following commands in a terminal window to install it:

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install --cask zulu@17']} />

After you install the JDK, add the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in **~/.bash_profile** (or **~/.zshrc** if you use Zsh):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="SDK 49 and below">

We recommend JDK 11 (you may encounter problems with higher JDK versions). Run the following commands in a terminal window to install it:

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install --cask zulu@11']} />

After you install the JDK, add the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in **~/.bash_profile** (or **~/.zshrc** if you use Zsh):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

#### Install and configure Android Studio

Android Studio allows installing Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device. They are required to set up the Android development environment. Follow the [instructions on the Android Studio Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to install these tools.

</Tab>

<Tab label='Windows'>

To set up your development environment on Windows for Android, you will install Node.js, JDK, and Android Studio.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

<Step label="1">

Install the LTS version of Node.js using Chocolatey. If you want to be able to switch between different versions, use a version manager such as [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to install Node.js

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Install [Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://openjdk.org/):

<Tabs>

<Tab label="SDK 50 and above">

For SDK 50 and above, install JDK version 17. You can download and install [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or your system packager.

</Tab>

<Tab label="SDK 49 and below">

For SDK 49 and below, install JDK version 11. You can download and install [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or your system packager.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Collapsible summary="iOS">

> **warning** A macOS is required to build projects with native code for iOS. You can create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to install the build on an iOS device.

To set up your development environment on macOS for iOS, you'll need to install Node.js, Watchman, Xcode, and CocoaPods.

#### Prerequisites

Use a package manager such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the following dependencies.

#### Install dependencies

## Local app compilation

To build your project locally you can use compile commands from Expo CLI which generates the **android** and **ios** directories:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '# Build native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
/>

The above commands compile your project, using your locally installed Android SDK or Xcode, into a debug build of your app.

- These compilation commands initially run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native directories (**android** and **ios**) before building, if they do not exist yet. If they already exist, this will be skipped.
- You can also add the `--device` flag to select a device to run the app on — you can select a physically connected device or emulator/simulator.
- You can pass in `--variant release` (Android) or `--configuration Release` (iOS) to build a [production version of your app](/deploy/build-project/#production-builds-locally).

To modify your project's configuration or native code after the first build, you will have to rebuild your project. Running `npx expo prebuild` again layers the changes on top of existing files. It may also produce different results after the build.

To avoid this, add native directories to the project's **.gitignore** and use `npx expo prebuild --clean` command. This ensures that the project is always managed, and the [`--clean` flag](/workflow/prebuild/#clean) will delete existing directories before regenerating them. You can use [app config](/workflow/configuration/) or create a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/) to modify your project's configuration or code inside the native directories.

To learn more about how compilation and prebuild works, see the following guides:

## Local builds with `expo-dev-client`

If you install [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-expo-dev-client) to your project, then a debug build of your project will include the `expo-dev-client` UI and tooling, and we call these development builds.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

To create a development build, you can use [local app compilation](#local-app-compilation) commands (`npx expo run:[android|ios]`) which will create a debug build and start the development server.
