This section contains information about the development with Expo and Expo Application Services (EAS):

- **Development process**: Learn about additional configurations and workflows that you may require during the development process to help you develop, deploy, and maintain your app. It contains in-depth information about [app config](/workflow/configuration/), [permissions](/guides/permissions/), [universal links](/guides/deep-linking/), [custom native code](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/), [web](/workflow/web/), and more.
- **Expo Application Services (EAS)**: Deeply integrated cloud services for Expo and React Native apps, from the team behind Expo. Learn about [EAS Build](/build/introduction/), [EAS Submit](/submit/introduction/), [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/), [EAS Metadata](/eas/metadata/), and [EAS Insights](/eas-insights/introduction/).

Apart from the essentials listed above, there are plenty of other features to explore such as [Push notifications](/push-notifications/overview/) and best practices on [distributing your app](/distribution/introduction/) to the app stores. We also have a collection of guides in the **Assorted** and third-party **Integrations** sections.
