> **Warning** TV development is available only in SDK 50 and later, and is still considered experimental. Not all Expo features and SDK modules are available on TV.

React Native is supported on Android TV and Apple TV through the [React Native TV project](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos). This technology extends beyond TV, offering a comprehensive core repo fork with support for phone and TV targets, including Hermes and Fabric.

Using the React Native TV library as the `react-native` dependency in an Expo project, it becomes capable of targeting both mobile (Android, iOS) and TV (Android TV, Apple TV) devices.

The necessary changes to the native Android and iOS files are minimal and can be automated with a [config plugin](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/config-tv/tree/main/packages/config-tv) if you use [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/). Below is a list of changes made by the config plugins, which you can alternatively apply manually:

- Android:
  - **AndroidManifest.xml** is modified:
    - The default phone portrait orientation is removed
    - The required intent for TV apps is added
  - **MainApplication.kt** is modified to remove unsupported Flipper invocations
- iOS:
  - **ios/Podfile** is modified to target tvOS instead of iOS
  - The Xcode project is modified to target tvOS instead of iOS
  - The splash screen (**SplashScreen.storyboard**) is modified to work on tvOS

## Quick start

The fastest way to generate a new project is described in the [TV Example](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-tv) within the Expo examples repository.

## Integration with an existing Expo project

If you have an existing Expo project, the following walkthrough describes the steps required to modify an Expo project for TV.

You will need:

- An Expo project using SDK 50 or later.
- **Android TV**:
  - In the Android Studio SDK manager, select the dropdown for the Android SDK you are using (API version 31 or later), and make sure an Android TV system image is selected for installation. (For Apple silicon, choose the ARM 64 image. Otherwise, choose the Intel x86_64 image).
  - After installing the Android TV system image, create an Android TV emulator using that image (the process is the same as creating an Android phone emulator).
- **Apple TV**:
  - Xcode 15 or later.
  - tvOS SDK 17 or later. (This is not installed automatically with Xcode. You can install it later with `xcodebuild -downloadAllPlatforms`).

> **Info** If you are starting with an SDK 49 project, you will need to [upgrade to SDK 50 or higher](/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/) before proceeding through the following steps.

## Limitations

Certain Expo modules are not supported at this time, most notably:

- `expo-dev-client`
- `expo-router`

<Step label="1">

## Modify dependencies for TV

In **package.json**, modify the `react-native` dependency to use the TV repo, and exclude this dependency from [`npx expo install` version validation](/more/expo-cli/#configuring-dependency-validation).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
{
  /* @hide ... your existing package.json */ /* @end */
  "dependencies": {
    /* @hide ... your existing dependencies */ /* @end */
    "react-native": "npm:react-native-tvos",
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  "expo": {
    "install": {
      "exclude": [
        "react-native"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Add the TV config plugin

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo install @react-native-tvos/config-tv']} />

Installing the library adds the `@react-native-tvos/config-tv` plugin to your project's **app.json**.

When installed, the plugin will modify the project for TV when either:

- The environment variable `EXPO_TV` is set to `1`
- The plugin parameter `isTV` is set to `true`

Make sure that this plugin appears in `app.json`. It is recommended to set the `showVerboseWarnings` property to `true` to see additional information during prebuild.

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@react-native-tvos/config-tv",
      {
        "showVerboseWarnings": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Run prebuild

Set the `EXPO_TV` environment variable, and run prebuild to make the TV modifications to the project.

<Terminal cmd={['export EXPO_TV=1', 'npx expo prebuild --clean']} />

> **Note**: The `--clean` argument is recommended, and is required if you have existing Android and iOS directories in the project.

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Build for Android TV

Start an Android TV emulator and use the following command to start the app on the emulator:

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo run:android']} />

</Step>
<Step label="5">

## Build for Apple TV

Run the following command to build and run the app on an Apple TV simulator:

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo run:ios']} />

</Step>
<Step label="6">

## Revert TV changes and build for phone

You can revert the changes for TV and go back to phone development by unsetting `EXPO_TV` and running prebuild again:

<Terminal cmd={['unset EXPO_TV', 'npx expo prebuild --clean']} />

</Step>

<Step label="7">

## Create EAS Build profiles for both TV and phone

Since the TV build is driven by the value of an environment variable, it is easy to set up EAS Build profiles that build from the same source but target TV instead of phone.

The following example **eas.json** shows how to extend existing profiles (`development` and `preview`) to create TV profiles (`development_tv` and `preview_tv`).

```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.2.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "base": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      },
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk",
        "withoutCredentials": true
      },
      "channel": "base"
    },
    "development": {
      "extends": "base",
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDebug"
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug"
      },
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "development_tv": {
      "extends": "development",
      "env": {
        "EXPO_TV": "1"
      },
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "preview": {
      "extends": "base",
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "preview_tv": {
      "extends": "preview",
      "env": {
        "EXPO_TV": "1"
      },
      "channel": "preview"
    }
  },
  "submit": {}
}
```
