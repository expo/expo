description: A guide on using Bun with Expo and EAS.

import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a JavaScript runtime and a drop-in alternative for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). In Expo projects, Bun can be used to install npm packages and run Node.js scripts. The benefits of using Bun are faster package installation than npm, pnpm, or yarn and [at least 4x faster startup time compared to Node.js](https://bun.sh/docs#design-goals), which gives a huge boost to your local development experience.

## Start a new Expo project with Bun

To create a new app using Bun, [install Bun on your local machine](https://bun.sh/) by running the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash']} />

Now, create your new Expo project:

<Terminal cmd={['bun create expo my-app']} />

You can also run any **package.json** script with `bun run`:

<Terminal cmd={['bun run ios']} />

To install any Expo library, you can use `bun expo install`:

<Terminal cmd={['bun expo install expo-av']} />

## Use Bun for EAS builds

EAS decides which package manager to use based on the lockfile in your codebase. If you want EAS to use Bun, run `bun install` in your codebase and ensure it creates a **bun.lockb** &mdash; the Bun lockfile. Make sure to delete any other lockfiles. As long as this lockfile is in your codebase, Bun will be used as the package manager for your builds.

### Customize Bun version on EAS

EAS uses `bun@1.0.2` by default. If you need to use a particular version of Bun, you can configure the exact version in each build in your **eas.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "test": {
      "bun": "1.0.0"
       /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    }
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  }
}
```

## Migrate to using Bun from npm, pnpm or yarn

It is currently not possible to import another package manager's lockfile into Bun (though this feature is being [worked on](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1751)). Until this is done, there is an element of risk to switching over to Bun on an existing project.

The purpose of a lockfile is to _lock_ down your dependency tree. If there is a library in **package.json** whose version number starts with a `^` or `~`, you are likely to end up with a different version of the package.

- `^` means you're opting into future minor and patch versions
- `~` means you're opting into future patch versions only

According to Semantic Versioning (SemVer), minor and patch versions do not include breaking changes. Unfortunately, breaking changes can still slip through. Since a lockdown file contains **specific versions** of dependencies, you will not get updates unless you explicitly opt-in. By deleting the lockfile, you are losing that safety and getting the latest versions available of all the packages as defined in your **package.json**.

To migrate to using Bun (use at your own risk):

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '$ rm -rf node_modules',
    '$ rm yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml package-lock.json',
    '$ bun install',
  ]}
/>

## Trusted dependencies

Unlike other package managers, Bun does not automatically execute lifecycle scripts from installed libraries, as this is considered a security risk. However, if a package you are installing has a `postinstall` script that you want to run, you have to explicitly state that by including that library in your [`trusted dependencies`](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) array in your **package.json**.

For example, if you install `packageA`, which has a dependency on `packageB` and `packageB` has a `postinstall` script, you must add `packageB` in your `trustedDependencies`.

To add a trusted dependency in your **package.json**, add:

```json package.json
"trustedDependencies": ["your-dependency"]
```

Then, remove your lockfile and re-install the dependencies:

<Terminal cmd={['$ rm -rf node_modules', '$ rm bun.lockb', '$ bun install']} />

## Common errors

### EAS Build fails when using Sentry and Bun

If you're using `sentry-expo` or `@sentry/react-native`, these depend on `@sentry/cli`, which updates source maps to Sentry during your build. The `@sentry/cli` package has a `postinstall` script which needs to run for the "upload source maps" script to become available.

To fix this, add `@sentry/cli` to your [trusted dependencies](/#trusted-dependencies) array in **package.json**:

```json package.json
"trustedDependencies": ["@sentry/cli"]
```
