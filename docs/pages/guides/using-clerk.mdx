[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a full stack authentication and user management platform that helps you add sign-up, sign-in, and account management without building your own auth backend. It supports multiple authentication strategies, session management, and organizations for multi-tenant apps.

Clerk provides hooks, UI, and control components so you can build completely custom authentication screens. Pair it with `expo-secure-store` to keep session tokens encrypted on device, and configure your projects's providers and policies in the Clerk's dashboard.

> **Note:** Clerk's [prebuilt UI components](https://clerk.com/docs/expo/reference/components/overview) are available for web only. For native platforms, Clerk recommends building custom flows.

## Features

- **Authentication flows:** Sign-up and sign-in with email verification code, magic links, passwords, social providers (20+), passkeys, phone number verification, SAML, OpenID Connect, Web3 (MetaMask), and authenticator apps for multi-factor authentication.
- **Session management:** Secure token handling with [`expo-secure-store`](/versions/latest/sdk/secure-store/).
- **User management:** Profile data, account settings, and organization membership for multi-tenant apps.
