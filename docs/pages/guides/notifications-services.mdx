Expo apps can work with any notification service or capabilities offered by the operating system thanks to [config plugins](/config-plugins/introduction/). The following services provide purpose-built Expo integrations for implementing push notifications in your app:

> The [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) library is designed and tested to work with Expo's push notification service. Some advanced features may not be compatible with third-party providers, as they often have their own native and React Native SDKs optimized for their services.

## Expo push notifications

[Expo Notifications](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) provides a unified API for handling push notifications across Android and iOS. It integrates seamlessly with your Expo account and is free to use.

#### Key capabilities:

- Fully compatible with the [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) library
- Includes an Expo Dashboard to track notifications and user engagement
- Supports testing notifications with the [Expo Notifications Tool](https://expo.dev/notifications)

#### Considerations and limitations:

- Does not support advanced platform features like notification extensions
- Limited to 600 notifications per second per project, which works for most apps but may not suit high-volume scenarios

For implementation details, see the [Expo push notifications overview](/push-notifications/overview) and [server-side SDK options](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#send-push-notifications-using-a-servers).

### OneSignal

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) is a customer engagement platform that provides push notifications, in-app messaging, SMS, and email services for web and mobile apps. It includes an [Expo SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin) for easy integration.

#### Key capabilities:

- Supports [Notification Service Extensions](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/service-extensions) for Android and iOS
- Provides a custom dashboard for managing notifications and user engagement

#### Considerations and limitations:

- Not free. OneSignal offers free limits, but advanced features (e.g., segmentation, automation) require a paid plan. See the [OneSignal pricing page](https://onesignal.com/pricing).
- Depends on OneSignal to maintain their Expo plugin and SDK.

### Braze

[Braze](https://www.braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that delivers personalized, cross-channel messaging through push notifications, in-app messaging, email, SMS, and web. It provides a [React Native SDK](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk) and an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main). Check out the [Expo example app](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main/example) for more details.

#### Key capabilities:

- Supports customizable push notifications with images, videos, and location
- Includes a dashboard for managing campaigns and journey orchestration

#### Considerations and limitations:

- Requires contacting Sales for pricing information
- Depends on Braze to maintain their Expo plugin and SDK

### Customer.io

[Customer.io](http://Customer.io) provides two main services:

- **Journeys**, for setting up campaigns and sending messages, emails, and push notifications
- **Data Pipelines**, for capturing and forwarding data from your Expo app, website, or other sources to the right destinations in your stack

It offers an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-expo-plugin) for seamless integration.

#### Key capabilities:

- Supports customizable push notifications with images, videos, and location
- Includes a dashboard for managing campaigns and journey orchestration

#### Considerations and limitations:

- Not free. Customer.io does not offer a free tier. The "Essentials" plan starts at $100/month. See the [Customer.io pricing page](https://customer.io/pricing) for more details.
- Depends on Customer.io to maintain their Expo plugin and SDK.

### Send notifications directly via FCM and APNs

In some cases, you may need to handle notifications natively for full customization. While this adds complexity, you can still use [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) to retrieve the native push token and configure notifications separately for each platform.

Although the client-side code remains cross-platform with [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/), you need to implement server-side logic to interact with the [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) and [APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) APIs individually.

### React Native Firebase Messaging

[React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) provides a messaging module that lets you use [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) as a unified push notification service for both Android and iOS. While FCM is often associated with Android notifications, it also supports iOS by routing messages through Apple Push Notification service (APNs) behind the scenes.

This approach differs from using FCM solely for Android notifications. Instead, Firebase's cross-platform SDK handles notifications for both platforms through a single service.

#### Key benefits:

- Uses a single API to send notifications to both platforms
- Simplifies server implementation with one integration point
- Provides Firebase's reliability and scalability
- Includes a free tier with generous limits

> Even though FCM handles notifications for both platforms, iOS notifications still go through APNs. Firebase automatically manages this routing. Learn more in the [React Native Firebase messaging documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage).

### Tips and important considerations

- **Avoid mixing client-side implementations**: Different notification services may have conflicting client-side implementations. Use a consistent approach to prevent potential issues.
- **Web notifications**: Expo notifications do not support web notifications. However, some third-party solutions may offer this capability. Consider your app's requirements when choosing a service.
- **Token management**: Track both Expo push tokens and native device tokens in your database. This provides flexibility for future integrations, especially with marketing tools that send notifications directly via FCM or APNs.
