A progressive web app (or PWA for short) is a website that can be installed on the user's device and used offline. If you build your native app with Expo, then Expo CLI can generate a lot of the PWA automatically based on how the native app works. Ex: icons, splash screens, orientation, and so on. [Add service workers](https://expo.fyi/enabling-web-service-workers) to get a complete PWA.

> This guide is oriented towards apps using webpack. If you use [Metro for web](/guides/customizing-metro/#web-support) (such as with [Expo Router](/routing/introduction)), you can still build a PWA. However, the Expo tooling suggested in this guide is not all intended for it. Use the [`web.output`](/versions/latest/config/app/#output) property with `single` as its default value to generate a SPA. You can then modify your **public/index.html** to add meta tags and PWA assets, and use [`expo-router/head`](/router/reference/static-rendering/#meta-tags) to set meta tags on each route. [Workbox](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/workbox/) is recommended for service workers.

## Usage

Expo web projects generate PWA assets and manifests by default, you only need to [add offline web support](https://expo.fyi/enabling-web-service-workers) to get a full PWA.

When you run `npx expo export:web` the webpack config reads your **app.config.js** (or **app.json**) and generates a PWA from it.

The following properties can be used to customize your PWA:

| **app.config.js**                               | **manifest.json**             | **index.html**                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `web.backgroundColor`                           | `background_color`            |                                                         |
| <CODE>web.description \| description</CODE>     | `description`                 | `<meta name="description" />`                           |
| `web.dir`                                       | `dir`                         |                                                         |
| `web.display`                                   | `display`                     |                                                         |
| `web.lang`                                      | `lang`                        | `<html lang="">`                                        |
| <CODE>web.name \| name</CODE>                   | `name`                        | `<title />`                                             |
| <CODE>web.orientation \| orientation</CODE>     | `orientation`                 |                                                         |
| `web.scope`                                     | `scope`                       |                                                         |
| <CODE>web.shortName \| web.name</CODE>          | `short_name`                  | `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title"/>`             |
| `web.startUrl`                                  | `start_url`                   |                                                         |
| <CODE>web.themeColor \| primaryColor</CODE>     | `theme_color`                 | `<meta name="theme-color" />`                           |
| `web.crossorigin`                               | `crossorigin`                 |                                                         |
| `web.relatedApplications`                       | `related_applications`        |                                                         |
| `web.preferRelatedApplications`                 | `prefer_related_applications` |                                                         |
| <CODE>android.icon \| icon</CODE>               | `icons`                       |                                                         |
| <CODE>ios.icon \| icon</CODE>                   |                               | `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" >`                        |
| <CODE>web.favicon \| icon</CODE>                |                               | `<link rel="shortcut icon" >`                           |
| `web.barStyle`                                  |                               | `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" />` |
| <CODE>web.splash \| ios.splash \| splash</CODE> |                               | `<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" >`               |

If you need finer control on how the PWA is generated, you should generate the **web/index.html** with `npx expo customize` and add it manually.

### Icons

Icons are generated in webpack using the [`expo-pwa`][expo-pwa] CLI. You can customize and override icon generation by using the `expo-pwa` CLI directly. [Learn more about `expo-pwa`][expo-pwa].

### Chrome

Chrome PWAs use the **manifest.json** and various meta tags in the `<head />` element of the website's **index.html**. Chrome PWAs are far more robust than iOS/Safari PWAs so you may find that certain features don't line up as well as they do natively.

### Safari

Safari PWAs do not use the **manifest.json**, instead they rely on meta tags in the `<head/>` element of a website's **index.html**. Expo unifies values as much as possible to simplify this.

- Safari icons are resolved with: `ios.icon | icon`.
  - All icons can be individually overwritten with `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" />` in the **web/index.html**
- Splash screens are resolved with: `web.splash | ios.splash | splash`.
  - All splash screens can be individually overwritten with `<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" />` in the **web/index.html**
- Status Bar Style is resolved with: `web.meta.apple.barStyle | web.barStyle`.
  - The default status bar style is `black-translucent` (the only full screen setting).
  - This can be overwritten with `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" />` in the **web/index.html**
- The home screen name is resolved with: `web.shortName | web.name | name`.
  - This can be overwritten with `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" />` in the **web/index.html**

### Offline

In order to add offline support, you'll need to add service workers to your project. We recommend using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) as it handles most of the heavy lifting.

### Related Applications

[Related applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#related_applications) are a way of telling your website which apps it should install in favor of a PWA, Expo websites try to recommend the native app when possible.

Related applications can be inferred automatically from the following native **app.config.js** properties:

```js app.config.js
export default {
  ios: {
    bundleIdentifier: 'com.myapp',
    appStoreUrl: 'app store url',
  },
  android: {
    androidPackage: 'package',
    // This is optional as it can be inferred from the androidPackage.
    playStoreUrl: 'play store url',
  },
};
```

**Optionally** you could override these values by manually defining the related applications:

```js app.config.js
export default {
  web: {
    relatedApplications: [
      {
        platform: 'itunes',
        url: 'app store url',
        id: 'iOS bundle identifier',
      },
      {
        platform: 'play',
        url: 'play store url',
        id: 'android package',
      },
    ],
    preferRelatedApplications: true,
  },
};
```

### Manual Setup

Under the hood `@expo/webpack-config` uses a CLI called `expo-pwa`. If you want more control on how PWAs are generated, you can use the `expo-pwa` CLI directly.

Firstly, you'll need to generate the **web/index.html** with `npx expo customize`. Now you can generate custom files and link them in the **web/index.html**. `@expo/webpack-config` will check to see if assets are linked first before attempting to generate new ones.

#### manifest.json

- `touch web/manifest.json` or `expo-pwa manifest`
- Add the following line to the `<head/>` element of your **web/index.html**:

```html web/index.html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
```

Now `npx expo export:web` will copy the **web/manifest.json** file into the build folder and skip converting the **app.config.js** or **app.json** into a **manifest.json**.

Note that if the `icons` property is not defined then the build step will still attempt to generate and append Chrome icons to your **manifest.json**.
