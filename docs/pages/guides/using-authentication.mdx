Authentication in mobile apps is how you identify who a user is, let them sign up or sign in, and keep their session securely connected across launches and devices. Authentication SDKs and libraries help you add these flows without building a custom auth backend. The guides below highlight popular SDKs and providers for your Expo and React Native projects.

> **warning** Some providers require custom native code and aren't supported in Expo Go. Use a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) when needed.
