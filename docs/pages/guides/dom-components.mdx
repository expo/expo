Expo offers a novel approach to working with modern web code directly in a native app via the `'use dom'` directive. This enables incremental migration for an entire website to a universal app, simply moving on a per-component basis.

The Expo native runtime generally does not support using `<div>` or `<img>` tags, but you may find that you want to quickly drop in some web components. This is where DOM components come in.

## Usage

To render a React component to the DOM, simply add the `'use dom'` directive to the top of a file:

```js my-component.js (web)
'use dom';

export default function MyComponent({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js App.js (native)
import MyComponent from './my-component.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    // This is a DOM component, it re-exports a wrapped `react-native-webview` behind the scenes.
    <MyComponent name="Europa" />
  );
}
```

## Features

- Shared bundler config across web, native, and DOM components.
- React, TypeScript, CSS, and all other Metro features are enabled in DOM components.
- Logging in the terminal and Safari/Chrome debugging.
- Fast Refresh and HMR.
- Embedded exports for offline support.
- Assets are unified across web and native.
- DOM Component bundles can be introspected in Expo Atlas for debugging.
- Access to all web functionality without needing a native rebuild.
- Runtime error overlay in development.
- Supports Expo Go.

## WebView props

To pass props to the underlying native **WebView**, add a `dom` object to the component:

```tsx my-components.tsx (web)
'use dom';

export default function MyComponent({}: { dom: import('expo/dom').DOMProps }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now you can pass [`WebView` props](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Reference.md) to the DOM component:

```tsx App.tsx (native)
import MyComponent from './my-component';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MyComponent
      dom={{
        scrollEnabled: false,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Marshalled props

You can send data to the DOM component through serializable props (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `Array`, `Object`):

```tsx App.tsx (native)
export default function App() {
  return <MyComponent hello={'world'} />;
}
```

```tsx my-component.tsx (web)
'use dom';

export default function MyComponent({ hello }: { hello: string }) {
  return <p>Hello, {hello}</p>;
}
```

These props are sent over an async bridge so they won't be updated synchronously. They're passed as props to the React root component meaning they re-render the entire React tree.

## Native Actions

You can send type-safe native functions to DOM components by passing async functions as top-level props to the DOM component:

```ts App.tsx (native)
import MyWebView from './my-component';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MyWebView
      hello={(data: string) => {
        console.log('Hello', data)
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```tsx my-component.tsx (web)
'use dom';

export default function MyComponent({ hello }: { hello: (data: string) => Promise<void> }) {
  return <p onClick={() => hello('world')}>Click me</p>;
}
```

> You cannot pass functions as nested props to DOM components. They must be top-level props.

Native actions are always asynchronous and only accept serializable arguments (i.e. no functions). This is because the data is sent over a bridge to the DOM Component's JavaScript engine.

Native actions can return serializable data to the DOM component, this is useful for getting data back from the native side.

```tsx
getDeviceName(): Promise<string> {
  return DeviceInfo.getDeviceName();
}
```

Think of these functions like React Server Actions, but instead of living on the server they live locally in the native app and communicate with the DOM component. This is a powerful way to add truly native functionality into your DOM Components.

## Feature detection

Because DOM components run websites, you may find yourself needing extra qualifiers to better support libraries. You can detect if a component is running in a DOM component with the following:

```js
if (
  typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
  // Detect if the webview global is available.
  typeof window.ReactNativeWebView !== 'undefined'
) {
  // ...
}
```

## Public assets

The contents of the root `/public` directory will be copied to the native app's binary to support using public assets in the DOM components. Consider the following:

```js
<img src="/img.png" />
```

{/* TODO: This is likely to change. */}

## Debugging

By default, all `console.log` methods are extended in WebViews to forward logs to the terminal. This makes it fast and easy to see what's happening in your DOM components.

Expo also enables WebView inspection and debugging when bundling in development mode. This means you can open Safari > Develop > Simulator > `MyComponent.tsx` to see the webview's console and inspect elements.

## Manual WebViews

You can still create a manual WebView using the `WebView` component from `react-native-webview`:

```js App.js (native)
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

export default function App() {
  return <WebView source={{ html: '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>' }} />;
}
```

This can be useful for rendering websites from a remote server.

## Measuring DOM Components

You may want to measure the size of a DOM component and report it back to the native side (ex: for native scrolling). This can be done using a native action:

```tsx App.tsx (native)
import MyComponent from './my-component';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Route() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(270);
  return (
    <MyComponent
      updateSize={async size => {
        if (size[1] !== height) {
          setHeight(size[1]);
        }
      }}
      dom={{
        style: { height },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```tsx my-component.tsx (web)
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function useSize(callback: (size: [number, number]) => void) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Observe window size changes
    const observer = new ResizeObserver(entries => {
      for (const entry of entries) {
        const { width, height } = entry.contentRect;
        callback([width, height]);
      }
    });

    observer.observe(document.body);

    callback([document.body.clientWidth, document.body.clientHeight]);

    return () => {
      observer.disconnect();
    };
  }, [callback]);
}

export default function Route({
  onLayout,
}: {
  dom: import('expo/dom').DOMProps;
  onLayout(size: [number, number]);
}) {
  useSize(onLayout);

  return <div />;
}
```

## Architecture

Built-in DOM support only renders websites as single-page applications (e.g. no SSR or SSG). This is because you don't need search engine optimization and indexing techniques in your embedded JS code.

When a module is marked with `'use dom'`, the module is replaced with a proxy reference which is imported at runtime. This feature is primarily just a number of bundler and CLI magic tricks. You can always use a WebView with the standard approach by passing raw HTML to a WebView component if you'd like.

DOM components that are rendered in websites or other DOM components will render as regular components and the `dom` prop will be ignored. This is because web content is passed directly through and not wrapped in an `iframe`.

Overall, this system shares a lot of similarities with Expo's React Server Components implementation.

## Considerations

We recommend always building truly native apps using universal primitives such as `View`, `Image`, and `Text`. DOM Components only support standard JavaScript which is slower to parse and startup than optimized Hermes bytecode.

Data can only be sent between DOM components and your native components via an async JSON transport system. Avoid depending on data across JS engines. Also avoid deep linking to nested URLs in DOM components as they currently do not support full reconciliation with Expo Router.

DOM Components are not exclusive to Expo Router but they are developed and tested against Expo Router apps, meaning you'll have the best experience using them with Expo Router.

If you have a global state for sharing data this won't be available across JS engines.

While native modules in the Expo SDK can be optimized to support DOM Components, we haven't done this yet. Use native actions and props to share native functionality with DOM components.

DOM Components and websites in general are less optimal than native views but there are some reasonable uses for them. For example, the web is conceptually the best way to render rich-text and markdown. The web also has very good WebGL support, with the caveat that devices in low-power mode will often throttle web framerates to preserve battery.

Many large apps also use some web content for auxiliary routes such as blog posts, rich-text (e.g. X long-form posts), settings pages, help pages, and other less frequently visited parts of the app.

## Limitations

- Unlike server components, you cannot pass `children` to DOM components.
- DOM components are standalone and do not automatically share data between different instances.
- You cannot add native views to DOM components. You can try to float native views over the top of DOM components but it may feel a bit janky.
- Function props cannot return values synchronously. They must be async.
- DOM components can currently only be embedded and do not support OTA updates, this can be added in the future as part of React Server Components.

Ultimately, universal architecture is the most exciting kind. Expo CLI's extensive universal tooling is the only reason we can even offer a feature as intricate and valuable as this one.

While DOM components help with migration and moving quickly, we recommend using truly native views whenever possible.
