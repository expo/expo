On devices running iOS 16 and above, you will need to enable a special OS-level **Developer Mode** setting before you can run [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution) builds (including those built with EAS) or local development builds installed on the device.

To enable it, you do not need to connect the device to a computer or use Xcode.

> This does not apply to builds signed using enterprise provisioning, nor to any builds installed on an iOS Simulator.

Follow the instructions below (once per device).

<Step label="1">
Install the build on your device and press the app icon.

</Step>

<Step label="2">
In the Settings app, navigate to **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**.

</Step>

<Step label="3">
Enable the toggle. You will receive a prompt from iOS to restart your device. Press **Restart** to do so.

<ImageSpotlight

  style={{ maxWidth: 480 }}
/>
</Step>

<Step label="4">
After the device restarts, unlock your device; a system alert should appear. Press **Turn On** and then, when prompted, enter your passcode.

  style={{ maxWidth: 480 }}
/>
</Step>

Developer Mode is now enabled, and you can now run internal distribution builds and local development builds.

You can turn off Developer Mode at any time, but note that you'll need to follow this same process again in order to re-enable it.
