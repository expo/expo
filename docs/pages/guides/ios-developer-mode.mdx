Devices running iOS 16 and above need to enable OS-level **Developer Mode** setting before they can run [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution) builds (including those built with EAS) or local development builds after installing them on the device.

## Prerequisites

The instructions specified below need to be followed once per device. **You'll also need to install your development build on your device before you can enable the Developer Mode.**

## Enable Developer Mode

<Step label="1">

After creating your first development build, follow the instructions from the Expo dashboard to install it on your iOS device.

After installing it, press the app icon. This will open an alert asking you to enable Developer Mode. Press **OK**.

<Step label="2">

Go the the Settings app, and navigate to **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Enable the toggle. You will receive a prompt from iOS to restart your device. Press **Restart**.

/>

</Step>

<Step label="4">

After the device restarts, unlock your device. A system alert should appear. Press **Turn On** and then, when prompted, enter your device's passcode.

/>

</Step>

Developer Mode is now enabled. You can now interact with your internal distribution builds and local development builds.

You can turn off Developer Mode at any time, however, note that you'll need to follow this same process again to re-enable it.

## Alternate method to enable Developer Mode

If you're unable to enable Developer Mode using the steps above, and you have a Mac, connect your device to your Mac and follow the instructions from [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device).
