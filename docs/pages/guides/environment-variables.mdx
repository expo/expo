Environment variables are key-value pairs configured outside your source code that allow your app to behave differently depending on the environment. For example, you can enable or disable certain features when building a test version of your app, or switch to a different API endpoint when building for production.

The Expo CLI will automatically load environment variables with an `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix from **.env** files for use within your JavaScript code whenever you use the Expo CLI, such as when running `npx expo start` to start your app in local development mode.

> Available in SDK 49 and higher.

## Reading environment variables from .env files

Create a **.env** file in the root of your project directory and add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `EXPO_PUBLIC_[NAME]=VALUE`:

```bash .env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://staging.example.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=abc123
```

Now you can use environment variables directly in your source code:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-native';

function Post() {
  const apiUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL;

  async function onPress() {
    await fetch(apiUrl, { ... })
  }

  return <Button onPress={onPress} title="Post" />;
}
```

When you run `npx expo start`, `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` will be replaced with `https://staging.example.com` in your app bundle. Variables can be updated as you edit your code without restarting the Expo CLI or clearing the cache. You will need to perform a full reload (for example, shake gesture and then Reload in Expo Go or your development build) to see the updated value.

> **warning** Do not store sensitive info, such as private keys, in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables. These variables will be visible in plain-text in your compiled application.

### How variables are loaded

Expo CLI loads **.env** files according to the [standard .env file resolution](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/blob/c6e583a/README.md#what-other-env-files-can-i-use) and then replaces all references in your code to `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_[VARNAME]` with the corresponding value set in the **.env** files. Code inside **node_modules** is not affected for security purposes.

### How to read from environment variables

- <YesIcon small /> **Every environment variable must be statically referenced as a property of `process.env`
  using JavaScript's dot notation for it to be inlined.** For example, the expression `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_KEY`
  is valid and will be inlined.

- <NoIcon small /> **Alternative versions of the expression are not supported**. For example, `process.env['EXPO_PUBLIC_KEY']`
  or `const {EXPO_PUBLIC_X} = process.env` is invalid and will not be inlined.

### Using multiple .env files to define separate environments

You can define any of the [standard .env files](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/blob/c6e583a/README.md#what-other-env-files-can-i-use), so it is possible to have separate **.env**, **.env.local**, **.env.production** and so on, files and they will load according to the standard priority.

You may choose to commit the default **.env** file or other standard configurations to version control, but generally **.env.local** files should be added to your **.gitignore**:

```bash .gitignore
.env*.local
```

If you create an environment-specific file, like **.env.test**, you can load it by setting `NODE_ENV` when running the Expo CLI:

<Terminal cmd={['$ NODE_ENV=test npx expo start']} />

### Disabling environment variables

Environment variables in Expo CLI have two parts and both can be disabled:

1. Expo CLI automatically loads the **.env** files into the global process. To disable this behavior, set the environment variable `EXPO_NO_DOTENV` to `1` before running any Expo CLI command: `EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1`.
2. Expo's Metro config includes the inline serialization of environment variables in the client JavaScript bundle. To disable this behavior, you can use `EXPO_NO_CLIENT_ENV_VARS=1`.

If you're experiencing issues with environment variables, you can try disabling one or both of these features.

## Environment variables in Expo Application Services

### EAS Build

[EAS Build](/build/introduction/) uses Metro Bundler to build the JavaScript bundle embedded within your app binary, so it will use **.env** files uploaded with your build job to inline `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables into your code. EAS Build also lets you define environment variables within build profiles in **eas.json** and via EAS Secrets. Check out the EAS Build documentation on [environment variables and build secrets](/build-reference/variables.mdx) for more information.

### EAS Update

[EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction) uses Metro Bundler in your local environment or CI to build your app bundle, so it will use available **.env** files to inline `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables into your code. Check out the EAS Update documentation on [environment variables](/eas-update/environment-variables/) for more information.

## Migrating to Expo environment variables

### From react-native-config

Update your **.env** files to prefix any variables used within your JavaScript code with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`:

```diff .env
- API_URL=https://myapi.com
+ EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://myapi.com
```

> If you have any non-standard **.env** files (for example, **.env.staging**), you will need to migrate those to one of the [standard .env files](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/blob/c6e583a/README.md#what-other-env-files-can-i-use).

Then update your code to use `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_[VARNAME]`:

```diff
- import Config from "react-native-config";

- const apiUrl = Config.API_URL;
+ const apiUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

### From babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables

Using a Babel plugin to transform your environment variable references in your code is similar to how Expo environment variables work. Set your variables inside of an **.env** file and update your variable names to use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix:

```diff
- const apiUrl = process.env.API_URL;
+ const apiUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

Then you can remove the plugin from your Babel config:

```diff babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
--    plugins: ['transform-inline-environment-variables'],
  };
};
```

After updating your Babel config file, be sure to clear your cache with `npx expo start -c`.

### From direnv

Move any environment variables used in your JavaScript from their **.envrc** file to a **.env** file and prefix it with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`.

Previously with `direnv`, you would need to use a [dynamic app config](/versions/latest/config/app/#app-config) that reads from [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/process.html#process_process_env) to set environment variables on the `extra` field so they can be used in your JavaScript code via [`expo-constants`](/versions/latest/sdk/constants). Move those references directly into your code, adding the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix:

```diff
- import Constants from 'expo-constants';

- const apiUrl = Constants.expoConfig.extra.apiUrl;
+ const apiUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

> [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) automatically loads and unloads environment variables in your shell depending on your current directory, meaning it can affect the environment for any process running in that directly, not just the Expo CLI. You will likely want to continue using `direnv` for other environment variables that are not used in your JavaScript code.

## Security considerations

Never store sensitive secrets in environment variables that are prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`. When an end-user runs your app, they have access to all of the code and embedded environment variables in your app. Read more about [storing sensitive info](https://reactnative.dev/docs/security#storing-sensitive-info).
