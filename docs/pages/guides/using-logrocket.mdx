import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

[LogRocket](https://logrocket.com) records user sessions and identifies bugs as your users use your app. You can filter sessions by update IDs and also connect to your LogRocket account on the Expo dashboard to get quick access to your app's session data.

## Install and configure LogRocket

You can install the LogRocket SDK with the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install @logrocket/react-native expo-build-properties']} />

Then, in your [app config](/workflow/configuration/), include the LogRocket config plugin:

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "android": {
          "minSdkVersion": 25
        }
      }
    ],
    "@logrocket/react-native"
  ]
}
```

Finally, initialize LogRocket in your app in a top-level file, like **app/\_layout.tsx**:

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
import LogRocket from '@logrocket/react-native';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    LogRocket.init('<App ID>', {
      updateId: Updates.updateId,
    });
  }, []);
};
```

In the code above, replace `<App ID>` with your [LogRocket App ID](https://app.logrocket.com/r/settings/setup).
