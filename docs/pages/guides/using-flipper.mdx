[Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) is a platform for debugging React Native projects running on an emulator/simulator or a physical device. It supports projects running on Android and iOS and is available as a desktop application on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It offers various features such as a device log viewer, interactive native layout inspector, network inspector, local database inspector, crash reporter and more. You can add more plugins available in the Flipper desktop app.

Debugging your Expo projects with Flipper requires the following:

- Creating a [development build](/development/introduction/) of your project
- Installing the [`expo-community-flipper`](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper) config plugin

> The `expo-community-flipper` library is a [config plugin](/guides/config-plugins/) that adds native code to your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- [Flipper desktop app](https://fbflipper.com/)
- [EAS CLI installed](/build/setup/#1-install-the-latest-eas-cli) and [logged in](/build/setup/#2-log-in-to-your-expo-account) to your Expo account

## Step 1: Run setup doctor

Open the Flipper desktop app and click the **Setup Doctor** button from the bottom left menu.

/>

If any dependencies are missing, follow the instructions provided by Flipper to install them.

## Step 2: Install expo-dev-client

Since Flipper requires native code, you'll need to create a development build. To set it up, install the `expo-dev-client` library:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-dev-client']} />

## Step 3: Install expo-community-flipper

The `expo-community-flipper` plugin depends on the `react-native-flipper` library. Run the following command to install both of them:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-community-flipper react-native-flipper']} />

## Step 4: Add the config plugin

In the **app.json**, add `expo-community-flipper` to the `plugins` array:

```json app.json
{
  "plugins": ["expo-community-flipper"]
}
```

## Step 5: Configure and install a development build

To configure and install a development build, follow the instructions below for:

- [Android Emulator or iOS Simulator](/development/create-development-builds/#on-emulatorsimulator)
- [Physical device](/development/create-development-builds/#on-a-device)

Once the build is complete, you can download them from [Expo's website](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/builds). From there, you can install them on your device or an emulator/simulator.

## Step 6: Run the development server

After installing the build, run the following command to start a development server:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start --dev-client']} />

Once the development server is running, open the Flipper desktop app and select your device or simulator under **App Inspect**:

## Limitations

In your project, if a third-party library uses `"useFrameworks": "static"` for iOS, integrating Flipper will not work since it is incompatible. For more information, see the [notice on the compatibility issue](https://github.com/jakobo/expo-community-flipper/issues/27) in the `expo-community-flipper` GitHub repository.
