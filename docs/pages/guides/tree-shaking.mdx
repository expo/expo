Tree shaking (also referred to as _dead code removal_) is a technique to remove unused code from the production bundle. Expo CLI employs different techniques, including [minification](/guides/minify), to improve startup time by removing unused code.

## Platform shaking

Expo CLI employs a process known as **platform shaking** for app bundling, where it creates separate bundles for each platform (Android, iOS, web). It ensures that the code is only used on one platform and is removed from other platforms.

Any code that is used conditionally based on the `Platform` module from `react-native` is removed from the other platforms. However, this exclusion specifically applies to instances where `Platform.select` and `Platform.OS` are directly imported from react-native in each file. If these are re-exported through a different module, they will not be removed during the bundling process for different platforms.

For example, consider the following transformation input:

```js Input
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  console.log('Hello on iOS');
}
```

The production bundle will remove the conditional based on the platform:

```js Output (Android)
/* @hide Empty on Android */
```

```js Output (iOS)
console.log('Hello on iOS');
```

This optimization is production only and runs on a per-file basis. If you re-export `Platform.OS` from a different module, it will not be removed from the production bundle.

<Collapsible summary="Enable platform shaking (SDK 49 and lower)">

> Platform shaking is enabled by default in Expo SDK 50 and greater.

To remove code based on the `Platform` module from `react-native`, add the following to **metro.config.js**:

```js metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.transformer.getTransformOptions = async () => ({
  transform: {
    /* @info This feature is experimental and may cause other issues. */
    experimentalImportSupport: true,
    /* @end */
  },
});

module.exports = config;
```

Then, configure **babel.config.js** to preserve `import/export` syntax:

```js babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  /* @info */
  const disableImportExportTransform = true;
  /* @end */
  return {
    presets: [
      [
        'babel-preset-expo',
        {
          native: {
            /* @info */
            disableImportExportTransform,
            /* @end */
          },
          web: {
            /* @info */
            disableImportExportTransform,
            /* @end */
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  };
};
```

Starting in SDK 51, `process.env.EXPO_OS` can be used to detect the platform that the JavaScript was bundled for (cannot change at runtime). This value does not support platform shaking imports due to how Metro minifies code after dependency resolution.

## Remove development-only code

In your project, there might be code designed to help with the development process. It should be excluded from the production bundle. To handle these scenarios, use the `process.env.NODE_ENV `environment variable or the non-standard `__DEV__` global boolean.

<Step label="1">

For example, the following code snippet will be removed from the production bundle:

```js Input
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('Hello in development');
}

if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('Another development-only conditional...');
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="2">

After _constants folding_ takes place, the conditions can be evaluated statically:

```js Post constants folding
if ('production' === 'development') {
  console.log('Hello in development');
}

if (false) {
  console.log('Another development-only conditional...');
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

The unreachable conditions are removed during [minification](/guides/minify):

```js Output (production)
/* @hide Empty file */
```

</Step>

To improve speed, Expo CLI only performs code elimination in production builds. Conditionals from the above code snippet are kept in development builds.

## Custom code removal

With Expo SDK 50, `EXPO_PUBLIC_` environment variables are inlined before the minification process. This means they can be used to remove code from the production bundle. For example:

<Step label="1">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js .env
EXPO_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FEATURE=true;
```

```js Input
if (!process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FEATURE) {
  console.log('Hello from the feature!');
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="2">

The above input code snippet is transformed to the following after `babel-preset-expo`:

```js Post babel-preset-expo
if (!'true') {
  console.log('Hello from the feature!');
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">
The above code snippet is then minified, which removes the unused conditional:

```js Post minifier
// Empty file
```

</Step>

- This system does not apply to server code as environment variables are not inlined in server bundles.
- Library authors should not use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` environment variables as they only run in application code for security reasons.

## Remove unused imports and exports

As of Expo SDK 50, unused imports and exports are not removed from the production bundle. We plan to add this feature to all platforms in a future release.

## Barrel files

> As of Expo SDK 50, there are no built-in optimizations for barrel files.

Barrel files export all of the modules in a directory. They are used to make importing modules easier. For example, a component-based icon library does the following:

```js node_modules/<example library>/index.js
export { default as IconA } from './IconA';
export { default as IconB } from './IconB';
export { default as IconC } from './IconC';
```

To reduce the bundle size, identify which of these modules you are using and try to import them directly. Learn more in [analyzing bundle size](/guides/analyzing-bundles).

## React Native web imports

`babel-preset-expo` provides a built-in optimization for the `react-native-web` barrel file. If you import `react-native` directly using ESM, then the barrel file will be removed from the production bundle.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="ESM">

If you import `react-native` using the static `import` syntax, the barrel file will be removed.

```js Input
import { View, Image } from 'react-native';
```

```js Output (web)
import View from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/View';
import Image from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/Image';
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="CJS">

If you import `react-native` using `require()`, the barrel file will be left as-is in the production bundle.

```js Input
const { View, Image } = require('react-native');
```

```js Output (web)
const { View, Image } = require('react-native-web');
```
