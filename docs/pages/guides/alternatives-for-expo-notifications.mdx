Expo apps can work with any notification service or capabilities offered by the operating system thanks to [config plugins](/config-plugins/introduction/). The following services provide purpose-built Expo integrations for implementing push notifications in your app:

> [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) library is developed and tested specifically with Expo's push notification service. Advanced features may not work with third-party providers, as they often have their own native and React Native SDKs optimized for their services.

### Expo Notifications

[Expo Notifications](/push-notifications/overview) provides a unified API for handling push notifications across iOS and Android. It integrates seamlessly with your Expo account and is completely free to use.

Key capabilities include:

- Fully compatible with [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) library
- Expo Dashboard to track notifications and user engagement
- Testing notifications via the [Expo Notifications Tool](https://expo.dev/notifications)

Limitations to consider:

- Not compatible with advanced platform features like notification extensions
- Rate limited to 600 notifications per second per project, which works for most apps but may not suit high-volume scenarios

For implementation details, see the [Expo push notifications overview](/push-notifications/overview) and [server-side SDK options](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#send-push-notifications-using-a-servers).

### OneSignal

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) is a customer engagement platform offering push notifications, in-app messaging, SMS, and email services for web and mobile apps. They provide an [Expo SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin) for easy integration. Follow the guide below for a step-by-step setup.

Key capabilities include:

- [Notification Service Extensions](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/service-extensions) for iOS and Android
- Custom Dashboard for orchestrating notifications and user engagement

Limitations to consider:

- It's not free. OneSignal has free limits, but advanced features (e.g., segmentation, automation) require a paid plan. See the [OneSignal pricing page](https://onesignal.com/pricing).
- Relies on OneSignal maintaining their Expo plugin and SDK.

### Braze

[Braze](https://www.braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that delivers personalized, cross-channel messaging through push notifications, in-app messaging, email, SMS, and web. They offer a [React Native SDK](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk) and an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main). Check out the [Expo example app](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main/example) for more details.

Key capabilities include:

- Customizable push notifications with support for images, videos, and location
- Dashboard for managing campaigns and journey orchestration

Limitations to consider:

- Need to contact Sales to get pricing information
- Relies on Braze maintaining their Expo plugin and SDK.

### Customer.io

[Customer.io](http://Customer.io) provides two main services - Journeys for setting up campaigns and sending messages, emails, and push notifications, and Data Pipelines for capturing and forwarding data from your Expo app, website, or other sources to the right destinations in your stack. They offer an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-expo-plugin) for seamless integration.

Key capabilities include:

- Customizable push notifications with support for images, videos, and location
- Dashboard for managing campaigns and journey orchestration

Limitations to consider:

- It's not free. Customer.io does not provide a free tier. The "Essentials" plan starts at $100/month. See the [Customer.io pricing page](https://customer.io/pricing) for more information.
- Relies on Customer.io maintaining their Expo plugin and SDK.

### Send Notifications Directly via FCM and APNs

Sometimes, you may need to handle notifications natively for full customization. While this increases complexity, you can still use [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) to get the native push token and configure notifications separately for each platform. Note that while the client-side code remains cross-platform using [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/), you'll need to implement server-side logic to interact with [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) and [APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) APIs individually.

### React Native Firebase Messaging

[React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) provides a messaging module that lets you use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) as a unified push notification service for both iOS and Android. While FCM is often associated with just Android notifications, it can actually handle iOS notifications by routing them through Apple Push Notification service (APNs) behind the scenes.

This approach differs from using FCM solely for Android notifications - instead, you'll use Firebase's cross-platform SDK to handle all notifications through a single service. The key benefits are:

- Single API for sending notifications to both platforms
- Simplified server implementation with one integration point
- Firebase's reliability and scalability
- Free tier with generous limits

> Note that even though you're using FCM for both platforms, iOS notifications still ultimately go through APNs - Firebase handles this routing automatically. Learn more in [React Native Firebase's messaging documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage).
