Expo simplifies push notification implementation by abstracting much of the complexity involved in communicating with [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) and [Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server). With Expo, you can handle notifications for both Android and iOS the same way, saving development time on both the front end and back end.

[Expo Notifications](/push-notifications/overview) require minimal configuration, and you can find many resources and tutorials to help you get started. Additionally, Expo offers tools like the [Expo Notifications Tool](https://expo.dev/notifications) for quick testing.

For server-side notification delivery, you have multiple SDK options. The Expo team maintains the [expo-server-sdk-node](https://github.com/expo/expo-server-sdk-node), and the community provides additional SDKs ([see the full list](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#third-party-sdks)). Alternatively, you can send an [HTTP/2 request](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#http2-api) directly to the Expo endpoint. This API does not require authentication, making it fast and easy to use.

**There is no cost** associated with sending notifications through the Expo push notification service.

Using Expo Notifications is optional. You can use methods from [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/), such as [`getDevicePushTokenAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#getdevicepushtokenasync), to retrieve the native push token and use it with other services.

## Limitations of Expo Notifications

- **Dependency on Expo**: Your app relies on Expo's push notification service.
- **Limited control**: Full customization, such as advanced background handling, may require direct FCM/APNs integration.
- **Rate limits**: Expo limits push notifications to **600 notifications per second per project**. If you exceed this rate, subsequent requests will fail until the rate drops below the limit. To manage this effectively, implement request throttling (included in the [`expo-server-sdk-node`](https://github.com/expo/expo-server-sdk-node)) and add retry logic to your server.

## Alternative Push Notification Providers

If you need more control or additional features, consider using a third-party push notification provider. Below are some popular services that offer advanced features and integrations with Expo.

### OneSignal

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) is a customer engagement platform offering push notifications, in-app messaging, SMS, and email services for web and mobile apps. They provide an [Expo SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin) for easy integration. Follow the guide below for a step-by-step setup.

### Braze

[Braze](braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that delivers personalized, cross-channel messaging through push notifications, in-app messaging, email, SMS, and web. They offer a [React Native SDK](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk) and an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main). Check out the [Expo example app](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-expo-plugin/tree/main/example) for more details.

### Customer.io

[Customer.io](http://Customer.io) provides two main services:

- **Journeys**: Set up campaigns and send messages, emails, and push notifications.
- **Data Pipelines**: Capture and forward data from your Expo app, website, or other sources to the right destinations in your stack.

They offer an [Expo plugin](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-expo-plugin) for seamless integration. Follow the guide below to get started.

## Native Push Notifications

Sometimes, you may need to handle notifications natively for full customization. While this increases complexity, you can still use [`expo-notifications`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) to get the native push token and configure notifications separately for each platform.

### FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) is a free, cross-platform messaging service for reliable message delivery. You can use it to notify client apps of new data, send messages, or handle real-time communication. Learn more in [Googleâ€™s documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging).

### APNs (Apple Push Notification Service)

[Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server) is the native iOS service for push notifications. The providers above wrap APNs with useful abstractions. If you integrate APNs directly, you must set up a provider server and configure your app to handle notifications on the user's device. Learn more in [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server).
