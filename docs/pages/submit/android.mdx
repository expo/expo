This guide outlines how to submit your app to the Google Play Store from your computer or from a CI/CD service.

## Submitting your app from your computer

<Prerequisites numberOfRequirements={7}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Sign up for a Google Play Developer account">
    A Google Play Developer account is required to submit your app to the Google Play Store. You can sign up for a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create an app on Google Play Console">
    Create an app by clicking **Create app** in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Create a Google Service Account">
    EAS requires you to upload and configure a Google Service Account Key to submit your Android app to the Google Play Store. You can create one with the [uploading a Google Service Account Key for Play Store submissions with EAS](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md) guide.
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={4} title="Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account">
    Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:
    
    <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli && eas login']} />
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={5} title="Include a package name in app.json">
    Include your app's package name in **app.json**:

    ```json app.json
    {
      "android": {
        "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={6} title="Build a production app">
    You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction/):
    
    <Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --profile production']} />

    Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform android --profile production --local` or with Android Studio.

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={7} title="Upload your app manually at least once">
    You have to upload your app manually at least once. This is a limitation of the Google Play Store API.

    Learn how with the [first submission of an Android app](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) guide.

  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can start the submission process.

Run the following command to submit a build to the Google Play Store:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android']} />

The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app. You can configure the submission process by adding a submission profile in **eas.json**. Learn about all the options you can provide in the [eas.json reference](/eas/json/#android-specific-options-1).

To speed up the submission process, you can use the `--auto-submit` flag to automatically submit a build after it's built:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --auto-submit']} />

Learn more about the `--auto-submit` flag in the [automate submissions](/build/automate-submissions/) guide.

## Submitting your app using CI/CD services

<Prerequisites numberOfRequirements={8}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Sign up for a Google Play Developer account">
    A Google Play Developer account is required to submit your app to the Google Play Store. You can sign up for a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create an app on Google Play Console">
    Create an app by clicking **Create app** in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Create a Google Service Account">
    EAS requires you to upload and configure a Google Service Account Key to submit your Android app to the Google Play Store. You can create one with the [uploading a Google Service Account Key for Play Store submissions with EAS](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/creating-google-service-account.md) guide.
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={4} title="Install EAS CLI and authenticate with your Expo account">
    Install EAS CLI and login with your Expo account:
    
    <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install -g eas-cli && eas login']} />
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={5} title="Include a package name in app.json">
    Include your app's package name in **app.json**:

    ```json app.json
    {
      "android": {
        "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={6} title="Provide a submission profile in eas.json">
    Then, you'll need to provide a submission profile in **eas.json** that includes your app's `serviceAccountKeyPath`:

    ```json eas.json
    {
      "submit": {
        "production": {
          "android": {
            "serviceAccountKeyPath": "../path/to/api-xxx-yyy-zzz.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    There are additional options available for Android submissions. Learn more from the [eas.json reference](/eas/json/#android-specific-options-1).

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={7} title="Build a production app">
    You'll need a production build ready for store submission. You can create one using [EAS Build](/build/introduction/):
    
    <Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform android --profile production']} />

    Alternatively, you can build the app on your own computer with `eas build --platform android --profile production --local` or with Android Studio.

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={8} title="Upload your app manually at least once">
    You have to upload your app manually at least once. This is a limitation of the Google Play Store API.

    Learn how with the [first submission of an Android app](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) guide.

  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline to submit your app to the Google Play Store.

### Use EAS Workflows CI/CD

You can use [EAS Workflows](/eas-workflows/get-started/) to build and submit your app automatically.

1. Create a workflow file named **.eas/workflows/submit-android.yml** at the root of your project.
2. Inside **submit-android.yml**, you can use the following workflow to kick off a job that submits an Android app:

   ```yaml .eas/workflows/submit-android.yml
   on:
     push:
       branches: ['main']

   jobs:
     build_android:
       name: Build Android app
       type: build
       params:
         platform: android
         profile: production

     # @info #
     submit_android:
       name: Submit to Google Play Store
       type: submit
       params:
         platform: android
         build_id: ${{ needs.build_android.outputs.build_id }}
     # @end #
   ```

   The workflow above will build the Android app and then submit it to the Google Play Store.

### Use other CI/CD services

You can use other CI/CD services to submit your app with EAS Submit, like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and more by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android --profile production']} />

This command requires a [personal access token](/accounts/programmatic-access/#personal-access-tokens) to authenticate with your Expo account. Once you have one, provide the `EXPO_TOKEN` environment variable in the CI/CD service, which will allow the `eas submit` command to run.
