**EAS Submit** is a hosted service for submitting your app binaries to the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

It makes submitting your apps simple and easy by creating and handling submission credentials and running the submission process. You can trigger a submission from a CLI command, after a build is finished, or from a CI/CD service. It's the fastest way to take Android and iOS builds and submit them to the app stores.

### What does "Submit" mean in EAS?

**Submit** is not the same as releasing your app directly to production. Instead, it delivers your app to the app stores' distribution pipelines (a chosen track on Google Play or TestFlight for iOS), following the [default submission behavior for app stores](/build/automate-submissions/#default-submission-behavior-for-app-stores).

**Android (Google Play Store)**

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to Google Play Console.
- What happens then: The build is placed in the track you specify (internal, alpha, beta, or production).
- Does this mean production?
  - If you use internal, alpha, or beta, the app is only available to testers in that track.
  - If you explicitly choose production, then yes - once Google approves the release, it will be available to all users.

**iOS (App Store Connect / TestFlight)**

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to App Store Connect.
- What happens then: The build becomes available in TestFlight.
- Does this mean production?: No - a TestFlight build is not automatically released to the Apple App Store.
- How production happens: You must log into Apple App Store Connect, choose the build, and submit it for App Review before it can be released to production.
