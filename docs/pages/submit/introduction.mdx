**Expo Application Services (EAS) Submit** is Expo's cloud service for submitting Android and iOS binaries directly to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store without using Google Play Console, App Store Connect or Transporter.

EAS Submit automates the final step of mobile app distribution by sending your built binaries to Google and Apple for store review. It removes the need for manual uploads and reduces errors that happen during store submission. It works with apps built with [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) or locally and supports multiple submission profiles. You can trigger a submission from a CLI command, after a build is finished, or from a CI/CD service. This gives teams a faster, more consistent release workflow across both platforms.

## Quick example

Submit an Android build:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android']} />

Submit an iOS build:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform ios']} />

Build and submit in one step:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --auto-submit']} />

## Why teams use EAS Submit

EAS Submit helps teams:

- Avoid manual uploads through Play Console, App Store Connect or Transporter
- Submit builds from [CI or automated workflows](/eas/workflows/pre-packaged-jobs/#submit)
- Standardize release processes via [eas.json](/eas/json/) config file
- Reduce human errors during submission

## What EAS Submit does

EAS Submit enables teams to:

- Upload Android binaries to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/about/)
- Upload iOS binaries to [App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/)
- Apply submission profiles for different environments

## How EAS Submit works

**EAS Submit** delivers your app to the app stores' distribution pipelines (a chosen track on Google Play Store or [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for iOS), following the [default submission behavior for app stores](/build/automate-submissions/#default-submission-behavior-for-app-stores). It queues up your app for distribution on the Play Store Console and App Store Connect, and then you can log into those sites to send your apps off to review, so then they can be distributed to your users.

### Android (Google Play Store)

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to Google Play Console.
- What happens then: The build is placed in the track you specify (internal, alpha, beta, or production).
- First-time submissions: Google requires you to upload your app manually at least once before API-based submissions work.
- Does this mean production?
  - If you use internal, alpha, or beta, the app is only available to testers in that track.
  - If you explicitly choose production, then yes &mdash; once Google approves the release, it will be available to all users.

### iOS (App Store Connect/TestFlight)

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to App Store Connect.
- What happens then: The build becomes available in TestFlight.
- Does this mean production?: No &mdash; a TestFlight build is not automatically released to the Apple App Store.
- How production happens: You must log into App Store Connect, choose the build, and submit it for App Review before it can be released to production.

## When to use EAS Submit

Use EAS Submit when you want to:

- Submit builds to the app stores without installing or interacting with upload tools
- Automate release workflows in CI
- Promote consistent submission processes across the team
- Manage multiple release channels from one configuration

<Collapsible summary="Do you want to upload a binary to a store?">

Yes, use EAS Submit.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Did you build your binary with EAS Build or locally?">

Either works. EAS Submit accepts any valid **.aab** (Android App Bundle) or **.ipa** (iOS App Archive) file.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do you want to automate submissions from CI?">

Yes, use EAS Submit with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do you need to handle metadata or screenshots?">

For Google Play Store, you must configure these manually. For App Store Connect, you can use [EAS Metadata](/eas/metadata/) to handle metadata automatically.

</Collapsible>

## When not to use EAS Submit

EAS Submit is not needed when:

- You are testing locally and not ready for a store submission
- You do not have a store listing configured yet

In these cases, preparing your store listing is required.

## FAQ

<Collapsible summary="Can I submit builds that were not built with EAS Build?">

Yes. Any valid binary can be submitted.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Submit for TestFlight?">

Yes. Submitting an iOS binary creates a TestFlight build.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Submit inside EAS Workflows?">

Yes. Submit commands can be triggered in automated pipelines. For more information, see [EAS Workflows pre-packaged jobs](/eas/workflows/pre-packaged-jobs/#submit).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="What credentials do I need?">

For Android, a Google Play Console developer account and a Google Service Account Key are required. For iOS, an Apple developer account and [`ascAppId`](/eas/json/#ascappid) (Apple App Store Connect unique application ID) are required.

For more information, see [Google's Play Store's prerequisites](/submit/android/#prerequisites) and [Apple's App Store prerequisites](/submit/ios/#prerequisites).
