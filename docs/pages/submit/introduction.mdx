**Expo Application Services (EAS) Submit** is Expo's cloud service for submitting Android and iOS binaries directly to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store without using Google Play Console, App Store Connect or Transporter.

EAS Submit automates the final step of mobile app distribution by sending your built binaries to Google and Apple for store review. It removes the need for manual uploads and reduces errors that happen during store submission.

EAS Submit works with apps built with [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) or locally and supports multiple submission profiles. You can trigger a submission from a CLI command, after a build is finished, or from a CI/CD service. This gives teams a faster, more consistent release workflow across both platforms.

## Quick start

Submit an Android build:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android']} />

Submit an iOS build:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform ios']} />

Build and submit in one step:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform ios --auto-submit']} />

## Why teams use EAS Submit

EAS Submit helps teams:

- Upload Android binaries to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/about/)
- Upload iOS binaries to [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/)
- Avoid manual uploads through Play Console, App Store Connect or Transporter
- Submit builds from [CI or automated workflows](/eas/workflows/pre-packaged-jobs/#submit)
- Standardize release processes via [eas.json](/eas/json/) config file
- Reduce human errors during submission

## How EAS Submit works

**EAS Submit** delivers your app to the app stores' distribution pipelines (a chosen track on Google Play Store or [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for iOS), following the [default submission behavior for app stores](/build/automate-submissions/#default-submission-behavior-for-app-stores). It queues up your app for distribution on the Google Play Console and App Store Connect, and then you can log into those sites to send your apps off to review, so then they can be distributed to your users.

### Android (Google Play Store)

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to Google Play Console.
- What happens then: The build is placed in the track you specify (internal, alpha, beta, or production).
- First-time submissions: Google requires you to upload your app manually at least once before API-based submissions work.
- Does this mean production?
  - If you use internal, alpha, or beta, the app is only available to testers in that track.
  - If you explicitly choose production, then yes &mdash; once Google approves the release, it will be available to all users.

### iOS (App Store Connect/TestFlight)

- Where it goes: EAS Submit uploads the build to App Store Connect.
- What happens then: The build becomes available in TestFlight.
- Does this mean production? No &mdash; a TestFlight build is not automatically released to the Apple App Store.
- How production happens: You must log into App Store Connect, choose the build, and submit it for App Review before it can be released to production.

## When to use EAS Submit

EAS Submit is useful when:

- Submit builds to the app stores without installing or interacting with upload tools
- Automate release workflows in CI
- Promote consistent submission processes across the team
- Manage multiple release channels from one configuration

## When not to use EAS Submit

EAS Submit is not needed when:

- You are testing locally and not ready for a store submission
- You do not have a store listing configured yet

Set up your store listing first before using EAS Submit.

## FAQ

<Collapsible summary="Can I submit builds that were not built with EAS Build?">

Yes. EAS Submit accepts any valid **.aab** (Android App Bundle) or **.ipa** (iOS App Archive) file.

For builds created with EAS Build, run `eas submit` and select a build from the list or let it use the latest build automatically.

For local builds, use the `--path` flag to specify the binary:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '$ eas submit --platform android --path ./my-app.aab',
    '',
    '$ eas submit --platform ios --path ./my-app.ipa',
  ]}
/>

The binary must be correctly signed. For Android, this means a release keystore. For iOS, this means a distribution certificate and provisioning profile.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Submit for TestFlight?">

Yes. All iOS submissions through EAS Submit are uploaded to App Store Connect and appear in TestFlight after processing. Processing typically takes 10-15 minutes but can vary.

Once processed, you can distribute the build to internal testers immediately or add external testers after a brief Beta App Review. To release to the App Store, you must manually submit the build for App Review through App Store Connect.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Submit inside EAS Workflows or from other CI/CD pipelines?">

Yes. EAS Submit works in CI environments and integrates with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/). You can add a submit job to your workflow configuration. For example:

```yaml
jobs:
  submit_ios_to_store:
    type: submit
    params:
      platform: ios
    after:
      - build_ios
```

For more information, see [EAS Workflows pre-packaged jobs](/eas/workflows/pre-packaged-jobs/#submit).

For CI pipelines, you can also use the `--non-interactive` flag to skip prompts and `--latest` to automatically select the most recent build:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas submit --platform android --latest --non-interactive']} />

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do I need to handle metadata or screenshots?">

EAS Submit uploads your binary but does not manage store listing metadata, screenshots, or release notes.

For Google Play Store, configure your store listing directly in [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/about/) before submitting.

For Apple App Store, you can use [EAS Metadata](/eas/metadata/) to automate app information and localized descriptions.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="What credentials do I need?">

For Android, you need a [Google Service Account Key](/submit/android/#creating-a-google-service-account) with access to your app in Google Play Console. Your app must be uploaded manually at least once before API submissions work.

For iOS, you need an Apple Developer account. EAS Submit requires your [`ascAppId`](/eas/json/#ascappid) (App Store Connect app ID) and will prompt for your Apple ID credentials or use an App Store Connect API Key if configured.

For more information, see [Google's Play Store's prerequisites](/submit/android/#prerequisites) and [Apple's App Store prerequisites](/submit/ios/#prerequisites).
