**EAS Submit** is a hosted service for uploading and submitting your app binaries to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Because it's a hosted service, as long as you can run EAS CLI on your machine you can submit your app to both stores. This means you can easily submit your iOS and Android apps from your macOS, Windows, or Linux workstation or from CI.
