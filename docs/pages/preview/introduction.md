title: Introduction

This section of the documentation provides a preview of experimental new features that we're working on at Expo. It is not linked from the main documentation but it is also not particularly well hidden &mdash; if you want to find it, [you can](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/docs/pages/preview/introduction.md). We just ask that you please keep the following in mind when exploring preview features:

1. 🚫 **Please don't produce blogs posts, YouTube videos, or other content covering the preview features.** Everything documented here is likely to change and the content will quickly go stale.
2. 👀 **You probably should not depend on preview features in production** unless you are prepared to deal with the instability that may come with a rapidly evolving product offering.
3. 💰 **Features that are free to preview may end up being paid services when they are released**. Don't plan your business around these features being free.
4. 💌 **Please provide us with detailed feedback from your experiences using experimental features** &mdash; from documentation to API interfaces to CLI commands, we want to hear your feedback now, because it will never be quite as easy to change it as during the preview phase. More information on this in [Support & Feedback](/preview/support/).

Thank you! Now take a look at the sidebar (or the `...` menu on mobile) to explore.
