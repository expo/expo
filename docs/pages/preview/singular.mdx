import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

> **warning** Singular routes are available from SDK 53 and above. They are currently flagged as `dangerouslySingular` due to an upstream issue with `react-native-screens`. Expo is working with Software Mansion to resolve the issue.

While a `Stack` normally operates with `push`/`pop` actions, in advanced scenarios you may wish to enforce a singular version of a screen in the stack. When enabled, any time a new screen is pushed the history will be scanned and any matching screens will be removed to ensure only a singular version exists.

## Options

There are two options for conditions:

- `true`: Use the default singular function
- `Function`: Specify your own singular function

The default singular function returns the screen's pathname without search params or the hash.

The singular identifier function has the signature of `(routeName: string, params: Record<string, string | string[]>) => string | undefined`.

## Assigning singular on the navigator

<FileTree files={['app/_layout.tsx', 'app/index.tsx', 'app/[profile].tsx']} />

Using the above example app, you can create a singular constraint to ensure that each `[profile]` page is unique.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
export default function () {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="[profile]" dangerouslySingular={({ profile }) => profile} />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

If you now navigate to `/profile-2` and your history is:

- `/profile-1`
- `/profile-2`
- `/profile-3`

The new history will push the new route, but also remove any previous entries:

- `/profile-1`
- `/profile-3`
- `/profile-2`

## Creating singular Links

`dangerouslySingular` can also be added to the `<Link />` component to create links that enforce singular routes.

```tsx
<Link href="/unique-link" dangerouslySingular />
<Link href="/unique-link" dangerouslySingular={(name) => name === 'unique-link' ? name : undefined} />
```

## Using the imperative API

The imperative API also accepts a `dangerouslySingular` option.

```tsx
router.navigate('/unique-link', { dangerouslySingular: true });
router.navigate('/unique-link', {
  dangerouslySingular: name => (name === 'unique-link' ? name : undefined),
});

router.push('/unique-link', { dangerouslySingular: true });
router.push('/unique-link', {
  dangerouslySingular: name => (name === 'unique-link' ? name : undefined),
});
```

## Navigate vs push

The `navigate` and `push` events apply the singular constraint differently.

- _navigate_: Only applies the constraint if the current route is changed
- _push_: Always applies the constraint

<FileTree files={['app/_layout.tsx', 'app/index.tsx', 'app/[profile].tsx']} />

Using the app structure above, if you have the history of:

- `/profile-1`
- `/profile-2`
- `/profile-2`
- `/profile-3`
- `/profile-2`

If you navigate to `/profile-2`, the singular constraint will not be applied as the current route is the target route when using `navigate`. However, if you push `/profile-2`, the singular constraint will be applied.

```tsx
// Will NOT apply the singular constraint as the current route is the target route
router.navigate("/profile-2", {
  dangerouslySingular: (_, { profile } => profile === 'profile-2' ? profile : undefined )
})

// Will apply the singular constraint
router.push("/profile-2", {
  dangerouslySingular: (_, { profile } => profile === 'profile-2' ? profile : undefined )
})
```
