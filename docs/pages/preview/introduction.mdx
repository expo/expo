This section of the documentation provides a preview of experimental new features that we're working on at Expo. It is not linked from the main documentation but it is also not particularly well hidden.

> **info** Pages behind `/preview` are not indexed on search engines.

We just ask that you please keep the following in mind when exploring preview features:

1. **Don't produce blogs posts, YouTube videos, or other content covering the preview features.** Everything documented here is likely to change and the content will quickly go stale.
2. **You probably should not depend on preview features in production**. Unless you are prepared to deal with the instability that may come with a rapidly evolving product offering.
3. **Features that are free to preview may end up being paid services when they are released**. Don't plan your business around these features being free.
4. **Please provide us with detailed feedback from your experiences using experimental features**. From documentation to API interfaces to CLI commands, we want to hear your feedback because it will never be quite as easy to change it as during the preview phase. More information on this in [Support and feedback](#support-and-feedback).

## Support and feedback

The purpose of feature previews is to gather feedback to polish and improve products before we ship them to a broader audience. We want you to kick the tires on these features and let us know how it goes. Try them with your largest app, your smaller app, a new app, an old app, and everything in between that you have the patience and curiosity to experiment with.

Direct all of your support questions and feedback to either a partner Slack channel (if you have one, you know what it is) or use **Share your feedback** or email us at [preview@expo.dev](mailto:preview@expo.dev).

Thank you! Now take a look at the navigation menu to explore the preview features.
