If you're looking to execute custom code before or after certain steps in the build process, but don't need to actually modify any of the steps, you may want to use the stable [build lifecycle hooks API](/build-reference/npm-hooks/).

Custom workflows allow running tests on the cloud, adding instructions for native platforms, resigning a build to share with your team or multiple test devices, and so on. With EAS Build, you can create build configs to customize the process by adding your workflows. It helps saving time especially when working in teams.

This guide shows how to create and use a custom build config with EAS. It follows a scenario where you create a custom workflow to run tests on EAS Build. You can also use the defined steps in other scenarios.

<Step label="1">

## Add a test to the project

To create a build config that runs tests, you have to prepare your project by installing `jest-expo` and `jest` as dependencies. Run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install jest-expo jest react-test-renderer']} />

Next, add a `test` script in **package.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-expo",
    "transformIgnorePatterns": [
      "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-svg)"
    ]
  }
}
```

For brevity, let's create an **App.test.js** at the root of your project and then add the following snippet:

```js App.test.js
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

import App from './App';

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('has 1 child', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();
    expect(tree.children.length).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

> See [Testing with Jest](/develop/unit-testing/) for more information about configuring the `jest-expo` package and additional configuration options such as `transformIgnorePatterns`.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Create a workflow

You must add a build config file in your project to create a workflow. Create a directory path **.eas/build** at the same level as **eas.json**. For example, if the **eas.json** file is at the root of your project, create the directory at that level. Both path and name of both directories are important for EAS Build to identify that a project contains a custom build config.

Inside it, you can create a new file called **test.yml**. This file contains the workflow config that you want to run. The filename is unimportant; you can name it whatever you want. The only requirement is that the file extension uses **.yml**.

This file will contain steps to run tests on the EAS Build service. It'll install all the required dependencies from the **package.json** file of your project and execute the `npm test` script.

Add the following workflow steps in the file:

```yaml .eas/build/test.yml
build:
  name: Run tests
  steps:
    - eas/checkout
    - run:
        name: Install dependencies
        command: npm install
    - run:
        name: Run tests
        command: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          npm test
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Add `config` property in eas.json

To use the custom build config, you must add the `config` property in **eas.json**. It contains the build config filename as the value you want to run on the EAS.

Let's create a new [build profile](/build/eas-json/#build-profiles) called `test` under `build` to run the custom config from the **test.yml** file:

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    "test": {
      "android": {
        "config": "test.yml"
      }
    },
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="4">

## Run build to test the workflow

To test the workflow, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build -p android -e test']} />

After the build is complete, you can verify that the `npm test` script was executed by checking the logs on the **build details** page.

</Step>

## Summary

- Build configs are customizable by adding steps you want to run on the EAS service as an extension to your existing regular builds.
- When the **eas.json** file contains the `config` property, credentials such as the keystore setup for Android and distribution certificate for iOS are skipped. This is not implemented yet because both the keystore and distribution certificate are unavailable on the server side.
- If an existing project already has credentials (keystore and distribution certificate), they remain unchanged.
- If your regular builds have [EAS secrets](/build-reference/variables/#adding-secrets-with-eas-cli), they are also available for custom builds.
