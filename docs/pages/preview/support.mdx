title: Support and feedback
---

The purpose of feature previews is to gather feedback to polish and improve products before we ship them to a broader audience. We want you to kick the tires on these features and let us know how it goes. Try them with your largest app, your smaller app, a new app, an old app, and everything in between that you have the patience and curiosity to experiment with.

Please direct all of your support questions and feedback to either a partner Slack channel (if you have one, you know what it is) or to [preview@expo.dev](mailto:preview@expo.dev).
