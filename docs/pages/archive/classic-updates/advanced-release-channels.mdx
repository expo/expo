## Introduction

For a quick introduction to release channels, read [this](./release-channels.mdx).

When you publish your app by running `expo publish --release-channel staging`, it creates:

- a release, identified by a `publicationId` for Android and iOS platforms. A release refers to your bundled source code and assets at the time of publication.
- a link to the release in the `staging` release channel, identified by a `channelId`. This is like a commit on a git branch.

For simplicity, the rest of this article will refer to just the `ios` releases, but you could swap out ios for android at any point and everything would still be true.

## See past publishes

You can see everything that you’ve published with `expo publish:history`.

#### Example command and output

`expo publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime            | appVersion | sdkVersion | platform | channel | publicationId                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z | 1.0.0      | 24.0.0     | ios      | staging | 80b1ffd7-4e05-4851-95f9-697e122033c3 |

To see more details about this particular release, you can run `expo publish:details`

#### Example command and output

`expo publish:details --publish-id 80b1ffd7-4e05-4851-95f9-697e122033c3`

## What version of the app will my users get?

Your users will get the most recent compatible release that was pushed to a release channel. Factors that affect compatibility:

- sdkVersion (standalone apps are built to support only a single SDK version)
- platform
- releaseChannel

The following flowchart shows how we determine which release to return to a user:

## Promoting a release to a new release channel

Example use case: you previously published a release to `staging` and everything went well in your testing. Now you want this release to be active in another release channel (ie) production

We run `expo publish:set` to push our release to the `production` release channel.
`expo publish:set --publish-id 80b1ffd7-4e05-4851-95f9-697e122033c3 --release-channel production`

Continuing from the previous section, we can see that our release is available in both the `staging` and the `production` release channels.

`expo publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime            | appVersion | sdkVersion | platform | channel    | publicationId                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z | 1.0.0      | 36.0.0     | ios      | staging    | 80b1ffd7-4e05-4851-95f9-697e122033c3 |
| 2018-01-05T23:55:04.603Z | 1.0.0      | 36.0.0     | ios      | production | 80b1ffd7-4e05-4851-95f9-697e122033c3 |
| 2018-01-04T22:43:19.302Z | 1.0.0      | 36.0.0     | ios      | production | d6b61741-a8dc-11e9-852a-3b0715b88238 |

## Rollback a release channel entry

Example use case: you published a release to your `production` release channel, only to realize that it includes a major regression for some of your users, so you want to revert to the previous version.

Continuing from the previous section, we rollback our `production` release channel entry for just the iOS platform with `expo publish:set`

`expo publish:set --release-channel production --publish-id d6b61741-a8dc-11e9-852a-3b0715b88238`

Or, we could rollback the `production` release channel entry for both iOS and Android with:
`expo publish:rollback --release-channel production --sdk-version 36.0.0`

Now we can see that our releases are available on the production release channel.

`expo publish:history --platform ios`

| publishedTime            | appVersion | sdkVersion | platform | channel    | publicationId                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2018-01-04T22:43:19.302Z | 1.0.0      | 36.0.0     | ios      | production | d6b61741-a8dc-11e9-852a-3b0715b88238 |
