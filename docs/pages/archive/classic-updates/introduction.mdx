Classic Updates was a service by Expo that delivered updates to end-users using Expo CLI's `expo publish` command. It was supported by Expo through August 2022, when it was replaced by [EAS Update](/eas-update).

Classic Updates will be sunset gradually throughout 2023 and 2024. If your project is using Classic Updates actively, please migrate to [EAS Update](/eas-update/migrate-from-classic-updates).
