A single native project on its own is complicated to maintain, scale, and update. In a cross-platform app, you have multiple native projects that you must maintain and keep up to date with the latest operating system releases to avoid falling too far behind in any third-party dependencies.

As your project grows, the complexity involved with each third-party dependency increases and makes the app nearly impossible to upgrade &mdash; this drastically slows down developer momentum, discourages adding complex native functionality, and leads to less powerful apps. To combat these issues, we formalized a process called **Continuous Native Generation (CNG)**.

Continuous Native Generation is an abstract concept that describes the process of generating ephemeral native projects from a set of inputs. The inputs are typically a combination of configuration and code, and the output is a native project that can be compiled into a native app. We coined this term to describe the process used by [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) to generate native projects for React Native apps, however, the concept is not limited to React Native or cross-platform apps.

## Usage in React Native

Any React Native app can leverage **Continuous Native Generation** by using [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild). This enables you to automate upgrading React Native, installing/uninstalling libraries, white-labeling at scale, sharing config across multiple apps, generating assets, reducing [orphaned code](/workflow/prebuild/#orphaned-code), and more &mdash; generally, it allows you to build more powerful apps, at larger scales, without compromising on iteration speed.

Expo as a framework enables **Continuous Native Generation** by combining the following tools:

1. The [app config](/workflow/configuration/) file.
2. Arguments passed to the `npx expo prebuild` command.
3. Version of `expo` that's installed in the project and corresponding [prebuild template](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-bare-minimum).
4. [Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#autolinking), for linking [native modules](/more/glossary-of-terms/#native-module) found in the **package.json**.
5. Native Subscribers, for reducing native code side-effects in entry files.
6. EAS Credentials for code signing additional targets and entitlements.

This boils down to a workflow where a user can express any native application with the app config and generate that project continuously &mdash; by running `npx expo prebuild`.

## Common questions

<Collapsible summary="How does CNG helps with project upgrades?">

React Native developers who don't use **Continuous Native Generation** have reported that upgrading their apps to the latest version of React Native is the number one weakness of the library as per [React Native Survey (2022)](https://results.2022.stateofreactnative.com/opinions/#opinions_pain_points).

When using CNG, the upgrade process simply involves upgrading the npm dependencies, app config, and re-running `npx expo prebuild --clean`.

<Collapsible summary="How a React Native library author can adopt CNG?">

React Native library authors can adopt CNG in several ways. It depends on the complexity of their libraries. Here are a few scenarios:

- **No native code or configuration side-effects**: Libraries without native code or configuration side-effects, such as `react-native-blurhash`, can seamlessly integrate with `npx expo prebuild`. They can rely on Node Module Resolution and Expo Autolinking to link into the native project without requiring any additional configuration.

- **Native code with no additional setup after install**: Libraries with native code can often be installed and linked automatically with [Expo Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#autolinking) which runs before the native app is built.

- **Additional configuration side-effects and setup**: Libraries that require additional configuration side-effects can adopt CNG by creating [Expo Config Plugins](/config-plugins/introduction/) for their libraries. This approach enables library authors to automate adding values such as permission messages to the **Info.plist**, or injecting targets in the Xcode project.

- **Libraries Dependent on Native Runtime Hooks**: Libraries that depend on specific native runtime hooks, such as intercepting the initial launch URL via the `AppDelegate`, `MainActivity`, `MainApplication`, and so on, can utilize [**Lifecycle listeners**](/modules/android-lifecycle-listeners/) to minimize the side-effects of their library.

Many complex libraries and services already support CNG via Expo Prebuild such as, [MapBox](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps), [OneSignal](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin), [Stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), and [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/#expo).

Adopting CNG by library authors is not a preqrequisite for using `npx expo prebuild`. If a library author has not adopted, developers can still use `npx expo prebuild` by creating local [Config Plugins](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/) to modify the native generation pipeline. This flexibility makes CNG accessible and beneficial to all users with the React Native community.

<Collapsible summary="Is CNG limited to React Native projects?">

No, CNG is a versatile pattern that can be applied to any native project. While Expo Prebuild is a tool that implements CNG specifically for React Native projects, the concept itself is not limited to this framework.

<Collapsible summary="How does community uses CNG?">

Here are a few community examples of difficult native features converted into simple configuration files, which has allowed developers to build more powerful apps without compromising on iteration speed:

- [iOS Safari Extensions](https://github.com/andrew-levy/react-native-safari-extension): You can see the process of creating a Safari Extension for iOS, which is a notoriously difficult feature to implement, boiled down to a couple of lines of JSON.

- [iMessage Sticker App](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/tree/main/packages/ios-stickers): This Expo Config Plugin can generate an entire iMessage Sticker App from a JSON object.

- [Cross-platform End-2-End testing](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/tree/main/packages/detox): Configure native apps to support E2E testing with Detox in a single-line.

- [Entire Firebase suite](https://rnfirebase.io/): Here you can see the entire native Firebase suite going from a multi-step native process across multiple IDEs, down to basic JSON configuration.

- [Cross-platform Home screen Widgets](https://github.com/gaishimo/eas-widget-example): This Expo Config Plugin can generate a home screen widget for Android and iOS.

- [Notification extension and code signing](https://github.com/OneSignal/onesignal-expo-plugin): This Expo Config Plugin not only generates a notification extension target on iOS. However, it also augments the EAS credentials service to keep zero-config code signing working.

- [Apple App Clips](https://github.com/bndkt/react-native-app-clip): This Expo Config Plugin takes the process of generating an Apple App Clip from a multi-step process, ranging across multiple targets, and shakes it down to a single line `["react-native-app-clip", { "name": "My App Clip" }]`.

At any point, these features can be easily added and removed, without any side effects. CNG allows developers to experiment with complex features, and iterate on them quickly without worrying about the long-term maintenance costs or potential orphaned code in their project or uncommitted native caches.

<Collapsible summary="Can CNG be used for operating systems other than Android and iOS?">

Absolutely! CNG is an abstract concept that can be applied to any operating system. Take Expo for example, although Expo Prebuild officially implements CNG for Android and iOS, it also provides abstract platform support for users to create implementations for additional platforms.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Is using Expo a requirement for CNG?">

Not at all. CNG is an open pattern that can be adopted by any community. We've defined the pattern abstractly to help other communities understand how they can adopt CNG for their own projects.

<Collapsible summary="How does CNG compare to web development patterns such as Static Site Generation (SSG)?">

CNG shares similarities with SSG in that it generates a project from a set of inputs. However, CNG differs from SSG in its output; it generates native runtime code instead of static website code. This means the native project is generated on-demand, and the generated source code and configuration are discarded once the native project is compiled into a native app.

<Collapsible summary="Is it possible to use CNG with an existing brownfield project?">

CNG is designed to manage the entire state of a native project continuously. As a result, it's not intended for use with existing brownfield projects. However, you can use CNG to generate a new native project, which can then be integrated into an existing brownfield project.
