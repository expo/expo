The Expo Go app is a great tool to get started. It exists to help developers quickly get projects off the ground, experiment with ideas (such as on [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)), and share their work with minimal friction. Expo Go makes this possible by including a feature-rich native runtime made up of every module in the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/), so all you need to do to use a module is install the package and reload your app.

The tradeoff is that Expo Go does not allow you to add custom native code. You can only use native modules built into the Expo SDK. Many great libraries are available outside of the Expo SDK, and you may even want to build your native library. You can leverage these libraries with development builds or using prebuild to generate native projects, or both. You can also continue using [EAS Build](/build/introduction) to release your app as no changes are required.

## Add custom native code with development builds

To use third-party libraries with custom native code and continue with the same developer experience of Expo Go, you can migrate to use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

Development builds are your personal version of Expo Go. They include the native runtime that powers your app. You control what is included in that native runtime by adding or removing libraries in the **package.json**. Development builds allow you to continue building your app in JavaScript while taking full advantage of the native libraries available for Expo and React Native projects.

To learn how to start using custom native code in your app by switching from Go to development builds, see [create a development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

## Generate native projects with prebuild

If you want to take control of Android and iOS native projects and move away from JavaScript-based project, you can generate native directories by running `npx expo prebuild` or `npx expo run:[android|iOS]` (which will run `prebuild` automatically). You can also use development builds in this context &mdash; run `npx expo install expo-dev-client` before `prebuild` or `run`. It is also possible to [add this library](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) later.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Build your native Android project',
    '$ npx expo run:android',
    '',
    '# Build your native iOS project',
    '$ npx expo run:ios',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="npx expo run:android && npx expo run:ios"
/>

- `npx expo run:android` requires Android Studio and the Android SDK to be installed. See how to [setup environment](/guides/local-app-development/#android).
- `npx expo run:ios` requires Xcode (macOS only) installed on your computer. See how to [setup environment](/guides/local-app-development/#ios).

The `run` commands will [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild/) your project to generate all the native code within your project directory. If you manually modify the **android** or **ios** directory, you cannot re-run `npx expo prebuild` safely. This is known as the [bare workflow](/archive/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow).

Your app can still run in Expo Go. However, any custom native code won't be accessible if it's [not present in the Expo Go app](/bare/using-expo-client).

If you install a library with Expo [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction/), you'll need to follow a few steps:

- Add the plugin to the [`plugins`](/versions/latest/config/app/#plugins) array in the project's app config.
- Re-run `npx expo prebuild` to sync the changes before rebuilding the native app. This process often involves tasks like adding required permissions to the **AndroidManifest.xml** or **Info.plist**.
- For complex plugins, consider running `npx expo prebuild --clean`. This command will delete and re-generate the native directories from scratch.

### Manual changes to the native project files

If you manually modify the **android** and **ios** directories, you must set up new libraries manually. Running `npx expo prebuild` may not work as expected because the project is now in an unpredictable state (think of this like running `yarn` after manually modifying your **node_modules** directory).

If you want to make static changes to your native project files, such as **AndroidManifest.xml** or **Info.plist**, and still have access to prebuilding, then create a [config plugin](/config-plugins/plugins-and-mods/#create-a-plugin) to see how you can hook into the prebuild process to make those changes.

### Revert changes from `npx expo run:[android|ios]`

Suppose you have decided to roll your app back to being fully managed (no **android** or **ios** directories in your project directory). In that case, you can check out your most recent commit before executing `npx expo run:[android|ios]`, then run `npm install` again to restore the state of your **node_modules** directory.

### Develop apps with custom native code

Once you have customized the native code in your project, you can use the [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-an-expo-dev-client) library to create a development build and retain the convenience of working with JavaScript or TypeScript in Expo Go. You can [create a development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for your managed or bare workflow.

## Release apps with custom native code to production

When you're ready to ship your app, you can [build it with EAS Build](/build/introduction) the same as you were building it before adding custom native code. Alternatively, you can archive and sign it locally. Unsurprisingly, we recommend EAS Build!

<Terminal
  cmd={['# Install the CLI', '$ npm i -g eas-cli', '', '# Build your app!', '$ eas build -p all']}
  cmdCopy="npm i -g eas-cli && eas build -p all"
/>

## Create native modules

The [Expo Module API](/modules/overview) enables developers to build modules for Expo and React Native projects using Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript. We use it for most modules in the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest). Learn more about the [Expo Module API design considerations](/modules/overview).

Another option is to use [React Native's Core Native Modules API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro), which may require some C++ knowledge in addition to Objective-C and Java. Most React Native modules in the ecosystem are built using this API because it is and always has been part of React Native. The Expo Module API is new and intends to solve many of the pain points of using the core API.
