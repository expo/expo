## Are apps built with Expo GDPR compliant?

**They can be! You can build GDPR compliant apps with Expo if you follow the requirements.**

While Expo ensures the proper handling and processing of developer data and end-user data, we cannot guarantee that the developers who build apps with Expo follow similar data privacy practices themselves.
