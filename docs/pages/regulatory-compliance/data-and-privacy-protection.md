title: Data and Privacy Protection
---

The Expo team's goal is to create tools and services that help developers build powerful & high quality apps, not collect massive amounts of data. Actually, the data we do collect is quite minimal, but this small amount of data helps us make decisions about our products and services, in addition to allowing us to deliver great user experiences.

That being said, as more and more laws, policies, and frameworks are introduced that aim to provide guidelines for how companies should treat user data, it's important that we are as transparent as possible to Expo's users about what data Expo collects, how, and why. This is also important since you, as a developer, need to know if the tools you are using treat your end users' data with integrity, so that you can be sure you are following any laws, frameworks, or guidelines that are relevant to you or your industry.

To accomplish this, we provide not only our [privacy policy](https://expo.dev/privacy), (which is mostly useful if you're a lawyer) but also our [privacy explained page](https://expo.dev/privacy-explained). This page lays out exactly what data Expo collects, both from our developers and your end users, and why we collect it.
