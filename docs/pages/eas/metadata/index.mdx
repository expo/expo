> **important** **EAS Metadata** is in beta and subject to breaking changes.

**EAS Metadata** is a command line tool from EAS (Expo Application Services) that enables you to automate and maintain your app store presence.

You need to provide a lot of information to multiple app stores before your users can use your app. This information is often about complex topics that don't apply to your app. You have to start a lengthy review process after providing the information. When the reviewer finds any issues in the information you provided, you need to restart this process.

EAS Metadata uses a [**store.config.json**](/eas/metadata/config/#static-store-config) file to provide information instead of going through multiple forms in the app store dashboards and without leaving your project environment. Combined with built-in validation, you get instant feedback about the content you provide, even before any review.

## Quick start

You can push the store config to the app stores by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas metadata:push']} />

> Using VS Code? Install the [Expo Tools extension](https://github.com/expo/vscode-expo#readme) for auto-complete, suggestions, and warnings in your **store.config.json** files.

## Key features

### Easy to configure, update, or maintain

You can start using EAS Metadata by [creating a new or generating a store config](/eas/metadata/getting-started/#create-the-store-config) from an existing app. This store config lets you quickly update the app store information without leaving your project environment. Before pushing the changes to the app stores, EAS Metadata looks for common pitfalls that might result in an app rejection.

### Faster feedback loop with validation

EAS Metadata comes with built-in validation, even before anything is sent to the app stores. This validation helps you iterate faster over the information without starting a review. Instead, you can begin the review process when everything is provided, and no issues are detected.

> Make sure to install the [VS Code Expo Tools extension](https://github.com/expo/vscode-expo#readme) to get auto-complete, suggestions, and warnings for **store.config.json** files.

### Extensible with dynamic store config

EAS Metadata also supports a more [dynamic store config](/eas/metadata/config/#dynamic-store-config), instead of only using JSON files.
This dynamic store config allows you to gather information from other places like external services. With asynchronous functions, there are no limits to adapting EAS Metadata to suit your preferred workflow.

| Manage app store info programmatically | Use EAS Metadata        |
| Catch metadata issues before review    | Use EAS Metadata        |
| Collaborate on store presence updates  | Use EAS Metadata        |
| Manage Google Play Store listings      | Use app store dashboard |

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Metadata with Google Play Store?" open>

We are committed to EAS Metadata and will expand functionality over time. This also means that not all functionality is implemented in EAS Metadata. The Google Play Store is one of those features currently not implemented.

See the [store config schema](/eas/metadata/schema/#config-schema) for all existing functionality.

<Collapsible summary="How do I use unsupported app store features?">

EAS Metadata only sends the data from your store config to the app stores.
It does not block you from using the app store dashboards if you need a feature that EAS Metadata does not cover yet.

When using EAS Metadata and editing something in the app store dashboards, make sure to run `eas metadata:pull` after these changes. Without updating your local store config, EAS Metadata might overwrite your changes when pushing to the app stores.

<Collapsible summary="How do I use EAS Metadata with a restricted app store account?">

You'll need to authenticate with the app store before EAS Metadata can access the information. If you are working with a large corporate account, you might not have permission to use all functionality of EAS Metadata. While you can use EAS Metadata in these cases, it's often more challenging due to the security restrictions.
