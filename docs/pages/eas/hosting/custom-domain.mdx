By default, your production deployment on EAS Hosting will look like this: `my-app.expo.app` , where `my-app` is your chosen preview subdomain name. If you own a domain, you may assign it as a custom domain to the production deployment.

Each project can have exactly one custom domain, which is assigned to the production deployment.

> **info** **Note**: Setting up a custom domain is a premium feature and isn't available on the free plan. Learn more about different plans and benefits at [EAS pricing](https://expo.dev/pricing).

## Prerequisites

<Collapsible summary="An EAS Hosting project with a production deployment">

The custom domain will always load the production deployment. Therefore, to add a custom domain to your project, you will need a deployment that's been promoted to production first.

You will need to own a domain name you want to use.

## Assigning a custom domain

1. In your project's dashboard, navigate to [Hosting settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[accountName]/projects/[projectName]/hosting/settings).
2. If you do not have a production deployment, you'll be prompted to assign one first.
3. Under **Custom domain**, enter the custom domain you'd like to set up. Both apex domains and subdomains are supported. If you own `example.com`, you can select:

   - `example.com`: apex domain
   - `anything.example.com`: a subdomain

4. Next, you'll be prompted to fill out some DNS records with your DNS provider:

   - **Verification**: to prove you own the domain
   - **SSL**: to set up SSL certificates
   - **CNAME** (subdomains) or **A record** (apex domains): to point the domain at your production deployment

5. Press the refresh button until all checks pass. Depending on your DNS provider, this step usually only takes a couple of minutes.

> If you require for the domain name switchover to be **zero downtime**, it's important to fill out these records one by one in the order they are presented in the table.
> That is, add the **TXT** record for verification, press the refresh button until the UI says verification is successful, then proceed to the next one.
> If downtime isn't important or relevant, you may add all three DNS records at once.

After assigning a custom domain to your app, the custom domain will route to your **production** deployment.
