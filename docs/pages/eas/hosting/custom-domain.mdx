By default, your production deployment on EAS Hosting will look like this: `my-app.expo.app` , where `my-app` is your chosen preview subdomain name. If you own a domain, you may assign it as a custom domain to the production deployment.

Each project can have exactly one custom domain, which is assigned to the production deployment.

> **info** **Note**: Setting up a custom domain is a premium feature and isn't available on the free plan. Learn more about different plans and benefits at [EAS pricing](https://expo.dev/pricing).

## Prerequisites

<Collapsible summary="An EAS Hosting project with a production deployment">

The custom domain will always load the production deployment. Therefore, to add a custom domain to your project, you will need a deployment that's been promoted to production first.

<Collapsible summary="A domain name">

You will need to own a domain name you want to use.

## Assigning a custom domain

1. In your project's dashboard, navigate to [Hosting settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[accountName]/projects/[projectName]/hosting/settings).
2. If you do not have a production deployment, you'll be prompted to assign one first.
3. Under **Custom domain**, enter the custom domain you'd like to set up. Both apex domains and subdomains are supported. If you own `example.com`, you can select:

   - `example.com`: apex domain
   - `anything.example.com`: a subdomain

4. Next, you'll be prompted to fill out some DNS records with your DNS provider:

   - **Verification**: to prove you own the domain
   - **SSL**: to set up SSL certificates
   - **CNAME** (subdomains) or **A record** (apex domains): to point the domain at your production deployment

5. Press the refresh button until all checks pass. Depending on your DNS provider, this step usually only takes a couple of minutes.

> If you require for the domain name switchover to be **zero downtime**, it's important to fill out these records one by one in the order they are presented in the table.
> That is, add the **Verification TXT** record first, and press "Refresh" until the UI confirms the verification record. Then add the **SSL CNAME** record next until
> it is confirmed, and set up the third record last.
> If downtime isn't important or relevant, you may add all three DNS records at once.

After assigning a custom domain to your app, the custom domain will route to your **production** deployment.

### Custom domain DNS records

Two of the three records the dashboard presents you are to validate ownership of your domain.
The **Verification TXT** record proves ownership of your domain, since it adds a custom token that can be read back to verify you're setting the domain up on a domain you control.
The **SSL CNAME** record proves ownership of your domain to a certificate authority, also known as Domain Control Validation (DCV). This is a CNAME record because both renewal and validation is delegated to an automated process, which prevents certificates from expiring.

Both records are created on a subdomain of the custom domain you're setting up.

- If you're setting up `example.com`, the records must be created on `_cf-custom-hostname.example.com` and `_acme-challenge.example.com` respectively
- If you're setting up `anything.example.com`, the records must be created on `_cf-custom-hostname.anything.example.com` and `_acme-challenge.anything.example.com` respectively

Lastly, the third DNS entry that the dashboard presents will always be the actual DNS record that points your domain at EAS Hosting.

- For apex domains, the dashboard typically recommends an **A record** to `172.66.0.241`
- For subdomains, the dashboard typically recommends a **CNAME record** to `origin.expo.app`

Both of these records are equivalent, however some DNS providers do not allow CNAME records to be set up on apex domains.

### Alias and wildcard subdomains

> **info** If you had a custom domain set up already before **March 19, 2025**, you must press the "Refresh" button in your project's [Hosting settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[accountName]/projects/[projectName]/hosting/settings) before following instructions for setting up wildcard domains.

While only a single custom domain can be set up per project, you can set up further subdomain DNS records to handle requests for other aliases than just the production alias.
Requests will be routed to the deployment whose alias matches the subdomain.

For example, after [creating a `staging` alias](/eas/hosting/deployments-and-aliases/#aliases), you may set up CNAME record for your alias:

- If you've set up an apex domain, for example `example.com`, create a CNAME record on `staging.example.com` set to `origin.expo.app`
- If you've set up subdomain domain, for example `anything.example.com`, create a CNAME record on `staging.anything.example.com` set to `origin.expo.app`

If you'd like to direct any subdomain request to any alias you've created, you may instead set up a wildcard CNAME record:

- If you've set up an apex domain, for example `example.com`, create a CNAME record on `*.example.com` set to `origin.expo.app`
- If you've set up a subdomain domain, for example `anything.example.com`, create a CNAME record on `*.anything.example.com` set to `origin.expo.app`

A wildcard CNAME record always starts with `*` and stands for any subdomain. As long as subdomains on your custom domain are set to `origin.expo.app`, EAS Hosting will attempt to send the request to the deployment assigned to an alias with a matching name.

The exceptions are `www` subdomains. If you've set up a `www` subdomain, and no alias named `www` exists, the request will be redirected to the custom domain with a 308 response and be treated as a request to the production deployment. If you wish to only set up an automatic redirection for the `www` subdomain on your custom domain, create a CNAME record on `www.<yourdomain>` set to `origin.expo.app`.
