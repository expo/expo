**EAS Hosting** is a service for quickly deploying the your web projects built using [Expo Router](/router/introduction/). It seamlessly integrates with the Expo CLI, allowing you to automate the deployment of API routes, server functions, and server-side assets.

Hosting supports both [static](/router/reference/static-rendering/) and [server mode](/router/reference/api-routes/) web projects and offers the fastest path from `npx create-expo-app` to a fully deployed web app with API routes.
