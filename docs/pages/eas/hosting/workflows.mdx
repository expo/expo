EAS Workflows is a great way to automate the React Native CI/CD pipeline for web deployment of your project to EAS Hosting with pull request (PR) previews and production deployments.

## Setup workflows

To use [EAS workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/) to automatically deploy your project, follow the instructions in [Get started with EAS workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/) and add the [GitHub integration](/eas/workflows/get-started/#configure-your-project) for your project.

## Create a deployment workflow

Add the following file to **.eas/workflows/deploy.yml**. This will use the production environment variables, export the web bundle, deploy your project and promote it to production whenever you push to the `main` branch.

```yaml .eas/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  deploy:
    type: deploy
    name: Deploy
    environment: production
    params:
      prod: true
```

Now, whenever a commit is pushed to `main` or a PR is merged, the workflow will run to deploy your website.

You can also test this workflow by triggering it manually:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run .eas/workflows/deploy.yml']} />
