EAS Workflows is a great way to automate the React Native CI/CD pipeline for deploying your project's website and API routes to EAS Hosting with pull request (PR) previews and production deployments.

## Set up workflows

To use [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/) to automatically deploy your project, follow the instructions in [Get started with EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/). You can also add the [GitHub integration](/eas/workflows/get-started/#configure-your-project) to connect a GitHub repository to your workflows.

## Create a deployment workflow

Add the following file to **.eas/workflows/deploy.yml**. This will use the production environment variables, export the web bundle, deploy your project and promote it to production whenever you push to the `main` branch.

```yaml .eas/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  deploy:
    type: deploy
    name: Deploy
    environment: production
    params:
      prod: true
```

Now, whenever a commit is pushed to `main` or a PR is merged, the workflow will run to deploy your website.

You can also test this workflow by triggering it manually:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run .eas/workflows/deploy.yml']} />

## Create a PR preview workflow

Add the following file to **.eas/workflows/pr-preview.yml**. This will automatically deploy a preview of your website whenever a pull request is created or updated, and post a comment to the PR with the deployment details.

```yaml .eas/workflows/pr-preview.yml
name: PR Preview

on:
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  deploy:
    type: deploy
    name: Deploy PR Preview

  comment:
    needs: [deploy]
    type: github-comment
```

This workflow will run whenever a pull request is opened, reopened, or synchronized. The `comment` job will automatically discover the deployment and post its details to the pull request, making it easy for reviewers to test your changes.
