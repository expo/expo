A workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. You must create a YAML file to define your workflow configuration.

To get started with workflows, see [Get Started with EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started) or see [Examples](/eas/workflows/examples) for complete workflow configurations.

## YAML syntax for workflows

Workflow files use YAML syntax and must have either a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension. If you're new to YAML and want to learn more, see [Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

Workflow files are located in the `.eas/workflows` directory in your project. The `.eas` directory should be at the same level as your [**eas.json**](/eas/introduction/eas-json) file.

For example:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['my-app/.eas/workflows/development-builds.yml', ''],
    ['my-app/.eas/workflows/pr-preview.yml', ''],
    ['my-app/.eas/workflows/deploy-to-production.yml', ''],
    ['my-app/eas.json', ''],
  ]}
/>

## `name`

The name of the workflow. This is displayed on the Expo dashboard on the workflows list page and is the title of the workflow's detail page.

```yaml
# @info #
name: My workflow
# @end #
```

## `on`

The `on` key defines which GitHub events trigger the workflow. Any workflow can be triggered with the `eas workflow:run` command, regardless of the `on` key.

```yaml
on:
  # Trigger on pushes to main branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  # And on pull requests starting with 'version-'
  pull_request:
    branches: ['version-*']
```

### `on.push`

Runs your workflow when you push a commit to matching branches.

With the `branches` array, you can trigger the workflow only when those specified branches are pushed to. For example, if you use `branches: ['main']`, only push to the `main` branch will trigger the workflow. Supports globs. Defaults to `['*']` when not provided, which means the workflow will trigger on push events to all branches.

```yaml
on:
  # @info #
  push:
    # @end #
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'feature/**'
      # other branches names and globs
```

### `on.pull_request`

Runs your workflow when a pull request event occurs on the matching branches.

With the `branches` array, you can trigger the workflow only when those specified branches are the target of the pull request. For example, if you use `branches: ['main']`, only pull requests to the `main` branch will trigger the workflow. Supports globs. Defaults to `['*']` when not provided, which means the workflow will trigger on pull request events to all branches.

With the `types` array, you can trigger the workflow only on the specified pull request event types. For example, if you use `types: ['opened']`, only the `pull_request.opened` event (sent when a pull request is first opened) will trigger the workflow. Defaults to `['opened', 'reopened', 'synchronize']` when not provided. Supported event types:

- `opened`
- `reopened`
- `synchronize`

```yaml
on:
  # @info #
  pull_request:
    # @end #
    branches:
      - 'main'
      - 'feature/**'
      # other branch names and globs
    types:
      - 'opened'
      # other event types
```

## `jobs`

A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs.

```yaml
jobs:
  # @info #
  job_1:
    # ...
  job_2:
    # ...
  # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>`

Each job must have an id. The id should be unique within the workflow and can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. For example, `my_job` in the following YAML:

```yaml
jobs:
  # @info #
  my_job:
    # @end #
    # ...
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.name`

The name of the job displayed on the workflow's detail page.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    name: Build app
    # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.environment`

The [EAS environment variable](/eas/environment-variables/) environment to set for the job. There are three possible values:

- `production` (default)
- `preview`
- `development`

The `environment` key is available on all jobs except for the pre-packaged `build` and `get-build` jobs.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    environment: production | preview | development
    # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.working_directory`

Sets the directory to run commands in for all steps in the job.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    defaults:
      run:
        working_directory: ./my-app
    # @end #
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        run: pwd # prints: /home/expo/workingdir/build/my-app
```

## Control flow

You can control when jobs run and what jobs must complete successfully before a job runs using the `needs` and `after` keywords. In addition, you can use the `if` keyword to control whether a job should run based on a condition.

### `jobs.<job_id>.needs`

A list of job IDs that must complete successfully before this job will run.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - uses: eas/use_npm_token
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules
      - name: tsc
        run: yarn tsc
  build:
    # @info #
    needs: [test] # This job will only run if the 'test' job succeeds
    # @end #
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.after`

A list of job IDs that must complete (successfully or not) before this job will run.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
  notify:
    # @info #
    after: [build] # This job will run after build completes (whether build succeeds or fails)
    # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.if`

The `if` conditional determines if a job should run.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
    # @end #
```

## Pre-packaged jobs

### `jobs.<job_id>.type`

Specifies the type of pre-packaged job to run. Pre-packaged jobs produce specialized UI according to the type of job on the workflow's detail page.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    type: build
    # @end #
```

Learn about the different pre-packaged jobs below.

#### `build`

Creates an Android or iOS build of your project using [EAS Build](/build/introduction/).

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    type: build
    # @end #
    params:
      platform: ios | android # required
      profile: string # optional, default: production
```

Build jobs can be customized so that you can execute custom commands during the build process. See [Custom builds](/custom-builds/get-started/) for more information.

#### `deploy`

Deploys your application using [EAS Hosting](/eas/hosting/introduction/).

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #

      alias: string # optional
      prod: boolean # optional
```

#### `get-build`

Retrieves an existing build from EAS that matches the provided parameters.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:

```

#### `submit`

Submits an Android or iOS build to the app store using [EAS Submit](/submit/introduction/).

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    type: submit
    # @end #
    params:
      build_id: string # required
      profile: string # optional, default: production
```

#### `update`

Publishes an update using [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/).

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    type: update
    # @end #
    params:
      message: string # optional
      platform: string # optional - android, ios, or all
      branch: string # optional
      channel: string # optional - cannot be used with branch
```

## Custom jobs

Runs custom code and can use built-in EAS functions. Does not require a `type` field.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # ...
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.runs_on`

Specifies the worker that will execute the job.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    runs_on: linux-medium | linux-large | linux-medium-nested-virtualization | linux-large-nested-virtualization | macos-medium | macos-large
    # @end #
```

| Worker                             | vCPU | Memory (GiB RAM) | SSD (GiB) | Notes                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| linux-medium                       | 4    | 16               | 14        | Default worker.                      |
| linux-large                        | 8    | 32               | 28        |                                      |
| linux-medium-nested-virtualization | 4    | 16               | 14        | Allows running Android emulators.    |
| linux-large-nested-virtualization  | 4    | 16               | 28        | Allows running Android emulators.    |
| macos-medium                       | 5    | 12               | 85        | Runs iOS jobs, including simulators. |
| macos-large                        | 10   | 20               | 85        | Runs iOS jobs, including simulators. |

Note: For iOS builds and iOS simulator jobs, you must use a `macos-*` worker. For Android emulator jobs, you must use a `linux-*-nested-virtualization` worker.

### `jobs.<job_id>.outputs`

A list of outputs for the job. Job outputs are available to all downstream jobs that depend on this job. Set outputs in a step using the `set-output` function.

In the example below, the `set-output` function sets the `test` output to `hello world` in `job_1`'s `step_1` step. Later in `job_2`, it's accessed in `step_2` using `needs.job_1.outputs.output_1`.

```yaml
jobs:
  job_1:
    # @info #
    outputs:
      output_1: ${{ steps.step_1.outputs.test }}
    # @end #
    steps:
      - id: step_1
        # @info #
        run: set-output test "hello world"
        # @end #
  job_2:
    needs: [job_1]
    steps:
      # @info #
      - id: step_2
        run: echo ${{ needs.job_1.outputs.output_1 }}
      # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps`

A job contains a sequence of tasks called `steps`. Steps can run commands or use an action.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    # @info #
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        run: echo "Hello World"
    # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step>.id`

The `id` property is used to reference the step in the job. Useful for using the step's output in a downstream job.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    outputs:
      test: ${{ steps.step_1.outputs.test }} # References the output from step_1
    steps:
      # @info #
      - id: step_1
        # @end #
        run: set-output test "hello world"
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step>.name`

The name of the step, which is displayed in the job's logs.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # @info #
      - name: My first step
        # @end #
        run: echo "Hello World"
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step>.run`

The command to run in the step.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # @info #
      - run: echo "Hello World"
        # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step>.working_directory`

The directory to run the command in. When defined at the step level, it overrides the `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.working_directory` setting on the job if it is also defined.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - run: pwd # prints: /home/expo/workingdir/build/my-app
        # @info #
        working_directory: ./my-app
        # @end #
```

### `jobs.<job_id>.steps.<step>.uses`

EAS provides a set of built-in reusable functions that you can use in workflow steps. The `uses` keyword is used to specify the function to use. All built-in functions start with the `eas/` prefix.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules
      - uses: eas/prebuild
      - name: List files
        run: ls -la
      # @end #
```

Below is a list of built-in functions you can use in your workflow steps.

#### `eas/checkout`

Checks out your project source files.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/checkout
        # @end #
```

#### `eas/install_node_modules`

Installs node modules using the package manager (bun, npm, pnpm, or Yarn) detected based on your project. Works with monorepos.

```yaml example.yml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules

/>

#### `eas/prebuild`

Runs the `expo prebuild` command using the package manager (bun, npm, pnpm, or Yarn) detected based on your project with the command best suited for your build type and build environment.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/prebuild
      # @end #
```

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules
      - uses: eas/resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials
        id: resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/prebuild
        inputs:
          clean: false
          apple_team_id: ${{ steps.resolve_apple_team_id_from_credentials.outputs.apple_team_id }}
      # @end #
```

| Property               | Type      | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                 | -         | The name of the step in the reusable function that shows in the build logs. Defaults to `Prebuild`.                                      |
| `inputs.clean`         | `boolean` | Optional input defining whether the function should use `--clean` flag when running the command. Defaults to false.                      |
| `inputs.apple_team_id` | `string`  | Optional input defining Apple team ID which should be used when doing prebuild. It should be specified for iOS builds using credentials. |

/>

#### `eas/send_slack_message`

Sends a specified message to a configured [Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks), which then posts it in the related Slack channel.
The message can be specified as plain text or as a [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) message.
With both cases, you can reference build job properties and [use other steps outputs](#jobsjob_idoutputs) in the message for dynamic evaluation.
For example, `'Build URL: ${{ eas.job.expoBuildUrl }}'`, `Build finished with status: ${{ steps.run_fastlane.status_text }}`, `Build failed with error: ${{ steps.run_gradle.error_text }}`.
Either "message" or "payload" has to be specified, but not both.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    steps:
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/send_slack_message
        # @end #
        inputs:
          message: 'This is a message to plain input URL'
          slack_hook_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/[rest_of_hook_url]'
```

| Input            | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`        | `string` | The text of the message you want to send. For example, `'This is the content of the message'`.<br /> <br />**Note:** Either `message` or `payload` needs to be provided, but not both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `payload`        | `string` | The contents of the message you want to send which are defined using [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) layout.<br /> <br />**Note:** Either `message` or `payload` needs to be provided, but not both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `slack_hook_url` | `string` | The URL of the previously configured Slack webhook URL, which will post your message to the specified channel. You can provide the plain URL like `slack_hook_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/[rest_of_hook_url]'`, use EAS secrets like `slack_hook_url: ${{ eas.env.ANOTHER_SLACK_HOOK_URL }}`, or set the `SLACK_HOOK_URL` secret, which will serve as a default webhook URL (in this last case, there is no need to provide `slack_hook_url` input). |

#### `eas/use_npm_token`

Configures node package managers (bun, npm, pnpm, or Yarn) for use with private packages, published either to npm or a private registry.

Set `NPM_TOKEN` in your project's secrets, and this function will configure the build environment by creating **.npmrc** with the token.

```yaml example.yml
jobs:
  my_job:
    name: Install private npm modules
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      # @info #
      - uses: eas/use_npm_token
      # @end #
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # <---- Can now install private packages
