The following workflows are examples of how you can use EAS Workflows to automate your development and release processes. They can help you and your team develop, review each other's PRs, and release changes to your users.

## Development builds workflow

[Development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) are specialized builds of your project that include Expo's developer tools. These types of builds include all native dependencies inside your project, enabling you to run a production-like build of your project on a simulator, emulator, or a physical device.

<Prerequisites summary="Prerequisites" numberOfRequirements={2}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Set up your environment">
    To get started, you'll need to configure your project and devices to build and run development builds. Learn how to set up your environment for development builds with the following guides:

<BoxLink
  title="Android device setup"
  description="Get your project ready for development builds."
  href="/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&platform=android&device=physical"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
/>

<BoxLink
  title="Android Emulator setup"
  description="Get your project ready for development builds."
  href="/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&platform=android&device=simulated"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
/>

<BoxLink
  title="iOS device setup"
  description="Get your project ready for development builds."
  href="/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&platform=ios&device=physical"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
/>

<BoxLink
  title="iOS Simulator setup"
  description="Get your project ready for development builds."
  href="/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&platform=ios&device=simulated"
  Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
/>

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create build profiles">
  After you've configured your project and devices, add the following build profiles to your **eas.json** file.

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "development-simulator": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

The following workflow creates a build for each platform and for both physical devices, Android emulators, and iOS simulators. They all will run in parallel.

```yaml .eas/workflows/create-development-builds.yml
name: Create development builds

jobs:
  android_development_build:
    name: Build Android
    type: build
    params:
      platform: android
      profile: development
  ios_device_development_build:
    name: Build iOS device
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
      profile: development
  ios_simulator_development_build:
    name: Build iOS simulator
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
      profile: development-simulator
```

Run the about workflow with:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas workflow:run .eas/workflows/create-development-builds.yml']} />

## Preview updates workflow

Once you've made changes to your project, you can share a preview of your changes with your team by publishing a [preview update](/review/share-previews-with-your-team/).

You can access preview updates in the development build UI and through scannable QR codes on the Expo dashboard. When publishing a preview on every commit, your team can review changes without pulling the latest changes and running them locally.

<Prerequisites summary="Prerequisites" numberOfRequirements={2}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Set up EAS Update">
    Your project needs to have [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction/) setup to publish preview updates. You can set up your project with:

    <Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create new development builds">
    After you've configured your project, create new [development builds](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for each platform.
  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

The following workflow publishes a preview update for every commit on every branch.

```yaml .eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml
name: Publish preview update

on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']

jobs:
  publish_preview_update:
    name: Publish preview update
    type: update
    params:
      branch: ${{ github.ref_name || 'test' }}
```

## Deploy to production workflow

When you're ready to deliver changes to your users, you can build and submit to the app stores or you can send an over-the-air update. The following workflow detects if you need new builds, and if so, it sends them to the app stores. If new builds are not required, it will send an over-the-air update.

<Prerequisites numberOfRequirements={3}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Set up EAS Build">
    To set up EAS Build, follow this guide:

    <BoxLink
      title="EAS Build prerequisites"
      description="Get your project ready for EAS Build."
      href="/build/setup/"
      Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
    />

  </Requirement>

  <Requirement number={2} title="Set up EAS Submit">
    To set up EAS Submit, follow the Apple App Store and Google Play Store submissions guides:

    <BoxLink
      title="Apple App Store CI/CD submission guide"
      description="Get your project ready for Apple App Store submissions."
      href="/submit/ios/#submitting-your-app-using-cicd-services"
      Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
    />
    <BoxLink
      title="Google Play Store CI/CD submission guide"
      description="Get your project ready for Google Play Store submissions."
      href="/submit/android/#submitting-your-app-using-cicd-services"
      Icon={BookOpen02Icon}
    />

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Set up EAS Update">
  And finally, you'll need to set up EAS Update, which you can do with:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />
  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

The following workflow runs on each push to the `main` branch and performs the following:

- Takes a hash of the native characteristics of the project using [Expo Fingerprint](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint/).
- Checks if a build already exists for the fingerprint.
- If a build does not exist, it will build the project and submit it to the app stores.
- If a build exists, it will send an over-the-air update.

```yaml .eas/workflows/deploy-to-production.yml
