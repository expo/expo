This page walks you through the process of creating your first EAS workflow for building and submitting your app to the app stores.

## Get started

<Prerequisites numberOfRequirements={4}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Sign up for an Expo account">
    You'll need to [sign up](https://expo.dev/signup) for an Expo account.
  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={2} title="Create a project">
    You'll need to create a project with the following command:

    <Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app@latest']} />

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={3} title="Sync the project with EAS">
    You'll need to sync the project with EAS with the following command. This will create an EAS project and link it to your local project:

    <Terminal cmd={['$ npx eas-cli@latest init']} />

  </Requirement>
  <Requirement number={4} title="Add eas.json">
    You'll need to add an `eas.json` file to the root of your project if it doesn't already exist:

    <Terminal cmd={['$ touch eas.json && echo "{}" > eas.json']} />

  </Requirement>
</Prerequisites>

<Step label="1">
  Create a directory named **.eas/workflows** at the root of your project with a YAML file inside of
  it. For example: **.eas/workflows/create-production-builds.yml**.

  <FileTree
  files={[
    ['my-app/.eas/workflows/create-production-builds.yml', ''],
    ['my-app/eas.json', ''],
  ]}
/>
</Step>

<Step label="2">

Add the following YAML to the `create-production-builds.yml` file:

```yaml .eas/workflows/create-production-builds.yml
name: Create Production Builds

jobs:
  build_android:
    type: build # This job type creates a production build for Android
    params:
      platform: android
  build_ios:
    type: build # This job type creates a production build for iOS
    params:
      platform: ios
```

The workflow above will create a production build for Android and iOS in parallel. To run this workflow successfully, you'll need to [set up and build your project using EAS CLI](/build/setup/) first.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

Finally, run the workflow with the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx eas-cli@latest workflow:run create-production-builds.yml']} />

Once you do, you can see your workflow running on your project's [workflows page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/workflows).

</Step>

### Automate workflows with GitHub events

You can trigger a workflow by pushing a commit to your GitHub repository. You can link a GitHub repo to your EAS project with the following steps:

- Navigate to your project's [GitHub settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5BprojectName%5D/github).
- Follow the UI to install the GitHub app.
- Select the GitHub repository that matches the Expo project and connect it.

Then, add the [`on` trigger](/eas/workflows/syntax/#on) to your workflow file. For example, if you want to trigger the workflow when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch, you can add the following:

```yaml .eas/workflows/create-production-builds.yml
name: Create Production Builds

# @info #
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  # @end #

  jobs:
    build_android:
      type: build
      params:
        platform: android
    build_ios:
      type: build
```
