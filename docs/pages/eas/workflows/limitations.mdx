EAS Workflows is designed to help you automate your development and release processes. However, it is good to be aware of certain limitations that we plan to address since they could affect your workflow automation strategy.

## No shared workflow configurations

At this time, it's not possible to define shared workflow configurations. Each workflow needs to be defined independently, which may lead to some configuration duplication.

## No matrix support

Matrix builds are not currently supported in EAS Workflows. This means you cannot run multiple variations of the same workflow in parallel with different configurations.

## Get notified about changes

To be notified as progress is made on these items, you can subscribe to the EAS newsletter on [expo.dev/eas](https://expo.dev/eas).
