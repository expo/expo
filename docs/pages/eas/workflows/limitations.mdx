EAS Workflows is designed to help you automate your development and release processes. However, it is good to be aware of certain limitations that we plan to address since they could affect your workflow automation strategy.

## Maestro tests are experimental

Maestro tests are currently in an experimental phase. While you can use them in your workflows, you may experience some flakiness in test results. We're actively working to improve the stability and reliability of Maestro test integration.

## No programmatic job status access

Currently, it's not possible to programmatically get the status of jobs for use in other CI workflows. This feature is on our roadmap and will be implemented in future updates.

## No shared workflow configurations

At this time, it's not possible to define shared workflow configurations. Each workflow needs to be defined independently, which may lead to some configuration duplication.

## No matrix support

Matrix builds are not currently supported in EAS Workflows. This means you cannot run multiple variations of the same workflow in parallel with different configurations.
