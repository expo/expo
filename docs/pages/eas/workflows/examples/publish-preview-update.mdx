Once you've made changes to your project, you can share a preview of your changes with your team by publishing a [preview update](/review/share-previews-with-your-team/). This is useful when you want to review changes with your team without pulling the latest changes and running them locally.

You can access preview updates in the development build UI and through scannable QR codes on the EAS dashboard. When publishing a preview on every commit, your team can review changes without pulling the latest changes and running them locally.

<Prerequisites summary="Prerequisites" numberOfRequirements={2}>
  <Requirement number={1} title="Set up EAS Update">

The following workflow publishes a preview update for every commit on every branch.

```yaml .eas/workflows/publish-preview-update.yml
name: Publish preview update

on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']

jobs:
  publish_preview_update:
    name: Publish preview update
    type: update
    params:
      branch: ${{ github.ref_name || 'test' }}
```
