The following sections cover how to create, scope, and consume environment variables with EAS dashboard and EAS CLI.

## Create environment variables

- [**Choose an environment or multiple environments**](/eas/environment-variables/#available-environments): `development`, `preview`, and `production` are available by default. A variable can be reused across them or customized per environment. You can also create a custom environment when adding a new environment variable.
- [**Choose scope**](/eas/environment-variables/#scope): project-wide variables apply to one project; account-wide variables can be reused across projects and are merged with project variables at runtime.
- [**Choose visibility**](/eas/environment-variables/#visibility-settings-for-environment-variables): Use **secret** for values that should never leave EAS servers, **sensitive** for values that may be revealed locally, and **plain text** for non-sensitive values.

### Create variables in the dashboard

To create a new environment variable on EAS servers, in your project dashboard, you can navigate to the **Project settings** > [**Environment variables**](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/environment-variables) and then click on the **Add Variables** button.

<ContentSpotlight

  src="/static/images/env-vars/creation-form.png"
  className="max-w-[600px]"
/>

Use the [environment variables creation form](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/environment-variables) page to set the name, value, environment(s), visibility, and optional description.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Create an environment variable form"
  src="/static/images/env-vars/add.png"
  className="max-w-[600px]"
/>

Created variables appear in the list with their scope, visibility, and environment tags. Based on the environment variables in this example, the list may look like this:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="List of successfully created environment variables"
  src="/static/images/env-vars/list.png"
  className="max-w-[600px]"
/>

In the above example list:

- The `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` variable is treated as as a sensitive environment variable. It is used to authenticate Sentry to upload source maps after builds and updates, and has to be accessible outside of EAS servers.
- The `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` variable is treated as a secret environment variable and uses an uploaded file. It is used to authenticate Google to access the Google Services JSON file, and has to be stored securely on EAS servers. This uploaded JSON file is typically added to your project's **.gitignore**.
- All other variables, such as `APP_VARIANT` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, are treated as plain text environment variables.

### Create variables with EAS CLI

Use `eas env:create` to add variables and `eas env:list` to verify what is set.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Example to create a new plain text environment variable for the preview environment',
    '$ eas env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL --value https://example.app/staging --environment preview --visibility plaintext',
    '',
    '# Example to list all environment variables for the preview environment',
    '$ eas env:list --environment preview',
  ]}
/>

## Using environment variables in your code

### Client-side values

The environment variables with the [`EXPO_PUBLIC_`](/guides/environment-variables) prefix are available as `process.env` variables in your app's code. You can use them dynamically to configure your app behavior based in their values:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-native';

function Post() {
  const apiUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL;

  async function onPress() {
    await fetch(apiUrl, {
      /* @hide ... */
      /* @end */
    });
  }

  return <Button onPress={onPress} title="Post" />;
}
```

In above example, `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is used to dynamically set the API URL for the fetch request.

> **warning** Do not put secrets in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables. Everything in client bundles is readable by end users.

### Build-time and app config

Other variables that are without `EXPO_PUBLIC` prefix, can be used during [app config](/workflow/configuration) resolution to configure your app's behavior. For example, the `APP_VARIANT` variable is used to determine the app name, package name, and bundle identifier for the selected [app variant](/build-reference/variants/):

Use non-prefixed variables in dynamic app config. Keep visibility at least **sensitive** if you need to resolve config locally (plain text and sensitive are readable in EAS CLI; secrets stay on the server).

```js app.config.js
const IS_DEV = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'development';
const IS_PREVIEW = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'preview';

const getUniqueIdentifier = () => {
  if (IS_DEV) {
    return 'com.yourname.stickersmash.dev';
  }

  if (IS_PREVIEW) {
    return 'com.yourname.stickersmash.preview';
  }

  return 'com.yourname.stickersmash';
};

const getAppName = () => {
  if (IS_DEV) {
    return 'StickerSmash (Dev)';
  }

  if (IS_PREVIEW) {
    return 'StickerSmash (Preview)';
  }

  return 'StickerSmash: Emoji Stickers';
};

export default {
  /* @info Using <CODE>getAppName()</CODE> for "name" property */
  name: getAppName(),
  /* @end */
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  ios: {
    /* @info Using <CODE>getUniqueIdentifier()</CODE> for "bundleIdentifier" property */
    bundleIdentifier: getUniqueIdentifier(),
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  android: {
    /* @info Using <CODE>getUniqueIdentifier()</CODE> for "package" property */
    package: getUniqueIdentifier(),
    /* @end */
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
};
```

### Secrets and file variables

Environment variables such as `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` is a secret file variable that is not readable outside of EAS servers and is used to provide the git ignored **google-services.json** file to an EAS Build job. To use it in the app config, you can use the `process.env` variable and provide a fallback value in case the variable is not set (for local development when you usually have it inside your project's repository):

```js app.config.js
export default {
  android: {
    googleServicesFile: process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON ?? '/local/path/to/google-services.json',
  },
};
```

## Manage environment variables

You can use [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/environment-variables) in your project or account to create, update, and delete environment variables.

You can also use EAS CLI to manage them. The following commands are provided as examples for `production` environment. When using these commands, replace `production` with the environment you want to manage.

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# To create a new environment variable',
    '$ eas env:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL --value https://example.app/staging --environment production --visibility plaintext',
    '',
    '# To update an existing environment variable',
    '$ eas env:update --name EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL --value https://example.app/staging --environment production --visibility plaintext',
    '',
    '# To delete an existing environment variable',
    '$ eas env:delete',
    '',
    '# To list all environment variables',
    '$ eas env:list --environment production',
    '',
    '# To pull environment variables into a .env file',
    '$ eas env:pull --environment production',
  ]}
/>

> **info** **Tip:** See the [EAS CLI command reference](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/blob/main/packages/eas-cli/README.md) for more information about the above commands.

### Pull variables for local development

The efficient way to use EAS environment variables for local development is to pull them into a **.env** file using the `eas env:pull --environment environment-name` command:

For example, to pull the environment variables for the `development` environment into a **.env** file, you can run:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas env:pull --environment development']} />

The created file may look like the following:

```bash .env.local
# Environment: development

APP_VARIANT=development
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://staging.my-api-url.mycompany.com
# GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON=***** (secret variables are not available for reading)
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=token
```

> **info** **Tip:** Keep generated **.env** files in **.gitignore** to avoid leaks and precedence conflicts between local and cloud jobs.

You can also use the **Export** option in the EAS dashboard to download the file and store it inside your project.
