EAS is the recommended way to manage variables for cloud builds and updates, but you can still work locally or with other tooling.

## Local development with Expo CLI

- Expo CLI loads `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables from **.env** files and inlines them into client bundles. Use this for values that are safe to ship to users.
- Add non-public variables to **.env** files for use in `app.config.js` or custom scripts. Keep these files in **.gitignore**.
- You do not need to restart the dev server to pick up **.env** changes; Expo CLI reloads them automatically.
- Link to Expo CLI [environment variables guide](/guides/environment-variables/).
