[EAS](/eas/environment-variables/) is the recommended way to manage environment variables for cloud builds and updates, but you can still work locally or with other tooling.

## Managing environment variables without EAS

If you want to manage environment variables without EAS, you can use tools like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (Node-based loaders) or services such as [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) that inject environment variables. These utilities allow you to create a **.env** file in which you can store your environment variables.

> **Note:** Avoid committing secrets to **.env** files if you are managing your environment variables without EAS.

## How environment variables are loaded

After creating **.env** file, you need to ensure that the file is committed to your project's Version Control System and is not listed inside **.gitignore** file. A **.env** file committed to your project, is picked by EAS commands like `eas build`, `eas update`, and so on.

The **.env** files load according to the standard .env file resolution and then replaces all references in your code to `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_[VARNAME]` with the corresponding value set in the .env files. Code inside **node_modules** directory is not affected for security purposes.
