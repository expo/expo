The following sections cover how to use environment variables in EAS builds, updates, and workflow jobs.

## Using environment variables with EAS Build

To have a full control over the environments used for your builds, you can specify the [`environment`](/eas/json#environment) field in the build profiles settings in the **eas.json** file.

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      /* @info Using <CODE>development</CODE> environment */
      "environment": "development"
      /* @end */
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    },
    "preview": {
      /* @info Using <CODE>preview</CODE> environment */
      "environment": "preview"
      /* @end */
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    },
    "production": {
      /* @info Using <CODE>production</CODE> environment */
      "environment": "production"
      /* @end */
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    },
    "my-profile": {
      /* @info Using <CODE>production</CODE> environment */
      "environment": "production"
      /* @end */
      /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    }
  }
}
```

All of the environment variables from the selected environment will be used during the build process. Plain text and sensitive variables will be available when resolving build configuration based on the dynamic app config in EAS CLI as well.

> **info** The environment variables of secret type are not available during build configuration resolution in EAS CLI as they are not readable outside of the EAS servers.

In this example app, all of the environment variables except `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` (which is secret) will be available during build configuration resolution in EAS CLI.

It's especially important in this context to have the correct visibility set for the `APP_VARIANT` variable so that the variable available in EAS CLI and is able to generate credentials for the correct package name and bundle identifier.

## Using environment variables with EAS Update

The most convenient way to use EAS environment variables with EAS Update is to run the `eas update` command with the `--environment` flag specified:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --environment production']} />

When the `--environment` flag is used, **only the environment variables from the specified EAS environment will be used during the update process** and won't use the **.env** files present in your project. This flag allows you to use the same environment variables while creating updates as with creating builds.

Expo CLI will substitute prefixed variables in your code (for example,`process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_VARNAME`) with the corresponding plain text and sensitive environment variable values set on EAS servers for the environment specified with the `--environment` flag. Any `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables in your application code will be replaced inline with the corresponding values from your EAS environment whether that is your local machine or your CI/CD server.

We recommend using the `--environment` flag to ensure the same environment variables are used both for your update and build jobs.

> **info** The secret variables will not be available during the update process as they are not readable outside of EAS servers.

## Using environment variables with EAS Hosting

An Expo Router web project can include environment variables that are used on both the client and the server. Client-side values are inlined in the JavaScript bundle when you run `npx expo export`, while server-side values are stored on the server and are deployed with your API routes when you run `eas deploy`.

> **warning** With EAS Hosting, only **plain text** and **sensitive** [environment variables](/eas/environment-variables/#visibility-settings-for-environment-variables) can be used. Secrets cannot be deployed with EAS Hosting.

<Collapsible summary="Client-side environment variables">

All code that runs in the browser is client-side. In an Expo Router project, this includes all code that is not an API Route or server function. The environment variables in your client-side code are inlined at build time. You should never put any sensitive information in your client-side code, which is why all client-side environment variables must be prefixed with [`EXPO_PUBLIC_`](/guides/environment-variables/).

When you run `npx expo export`, all instances of `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` environment variables will be replaced with values from the environment.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Server-side environment variables">

All the code in your [API routes](/router/web/api-routes/) (files ending with **+api.ts**) run on the server. Since the code running on the server is never visible to the app user, you can safely use sensitive environment variables such as API keys and tokens.

Server-side environment variables are not inlined in the code, they are uploaded with the deployment when you run the `eas deploy` command.

### Storing environment variables

When deploying a project with EAS environment variables, note that the environment variables for the client-side and server-side code are included at different steps:

- Running `npx expo export --platform web` will inline the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables in the frontend code. So ensure that your **.env.local** file includes the correct environment variables before running the `npx export` command.
- `eas deploy --environment production` will include all variables for the given environment (in this case, `production`) in the API routes. EAS Environment variables loaded with the `--environment` flag will take precedence over ones defined in **.env** and **.env.local** files.

> **warning** **Environment variables are per deployment, and deployments are immutable**. This means that after changing an environment variable, you will need to re-export your project, and re-deploy in order for them to be updated.

### For local development

For local development, both client- and server-side environment variables are loaded from [local **.env** files](/guides/environment-variables/), which should be gitignored. If you are using EAS environment variables, use [`eas env:pull`](/eas/environment-variables/manage/#pull-variables-for-local-development) to retrieve the environment variables for `development`, `preview`, or `production`.

## Using environment variables for other commands

One way to supply non-secret EAS environment variables to other EAS commands is to use the `eas env:exec` command.

<Terminal cmd={["$ eas env:exec --environment production 'echo $APP_VARIANT'"]} />

For example, it can be useful when uploading source maps to Sentry using a [`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`](/guides/using-sentry) variable after an update bundle is created.

<Terminal
  cmd={["$ eas env:exec --environment production 'npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist'"]}
/>

## EAS Build and Workflows job runs

### Setting the environment for your builds

To set the environment for your EAS Build jobs, you can use the `environment` option in **eas.json** and set it to one of the available environments: `development`, `preview` or `production`.

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "environment": "development"
    },
    "preview": {
      "environment": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      "environment": "production"
    },
    "my-profile": {
      "environment": "production"
  }
}
```

If you don't set the `environment` option, we will set the environment automatically based on your build's configuration:

- `development`: for development client build
- `preview`: for other configurations
- `production`: for app store build

<Collapsible summary="Built-in environment variables">

The following environment variables are additional system environment variables exposed to each job and can be used within any build step. They are not a part of any project environment and are not available when evaluating **app.config.js** locally:

- `CI=1`: Indicates this is a CI environment
- `EAS_BUILD=true`: Indicates this is an EAS Build environment
- `EAS_BUILD_PLATFORM`: Either `android` or `ios`
- `EAS_BUILD_RUNNER`: Either `eas-build` for EAS Build cloud builds or `local-build-plugin` for [local builds](/build-reference/local-builds/)
- `EAS_BUILD_ID`: The build ID, for example, `f51831f0-ea30-406a-8c5f-f8e1cc57d39c`
- `EAS_BUILD_PROFILE`: The name of the build profile from **eas.json**, for example, `production`
- `EAS_BUILD_GIT_COMMIT_HASH`: The hash of the Git commit, for example, `88f28ab5ea39108ade978de2d0d1adeedf0ece76`
- `EAS_BUILD_NPM_CACHE_URL`: The URL of npm cache ([learn more](/build-reference/private-npm-packages))
- `EAS_BUILD_MAVEN_CACHE_URL`: The URL of Maven cache ([learn more](/build-reference/caching/#android-dependencies))
- `EAS_BUILD_COCOAPODS_CACHE_URL`: The URL of CocoaPods cache ([learn more](/build-reference/caching/#ios-dependencies))
- `EAS_BUILD_USERNAME`: The username of the user initiating the build (it's undefined for bot users)
- `EAS_BUILD_WORKINGDIR`: The remote directory path with your project

### Dynamically setting environment variables during the job execution

You can also set environment variables dynamically during the job execution using the `set-env` command.
The `set-env` executable is available in the `PATH` on EAS Build workers, and can be used to set environment variables that will be visible in the next build phases.

For example, you can add the following in one of the [EAS Build hooks](/build-reference/npm-hooks/) and the environment variable `EXAMPLE_ENV` will be available until the end of the build job.

<Terminal cmd={['$ set-env EXAMPLE_ENV "example value"']} />

### Accessing environment variables

After creating an environment variable, you can read it on subsequent EAS Build jobs with `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` from Node.js or in shell scripts as `$VARIABLE_NAME`.
