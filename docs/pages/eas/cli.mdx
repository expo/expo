You can use EAS Command-Line Interface (CLI) to build, update, submit, deploy or use workflows in your Expo and React Native project from a terminal window.

## Installation

You need to install the EAS CLI globally on your machine. You do this by running the following command:

<Terminal
  cmd={{
    npm: ['$ npm install --global eas-cli'],
    yarn: ['$ yarn global add eas-cli'],
    pnpm: ['$ pnpm add -g eas-cli'],
    bun: ['$ bun add -g eas-cli'],
  }}
/>

Alternatively, you can use CLI tools provided by your package manager to run EAS CLI commands:

<Terminal
  cmd={{
    npm: ['$ npx eas-cli@latest'],
    yarn: ['$ yarn dlx eas-cli@latest'],
    pnpm: ['$ pnpm dlx eas-cli@latest'],
    bun: ['$ bunx eas-cli@latest'],
  }}
/>

## Commands

Use the EAS CLI by running one of the commands documented on this page, optionally followed by any flags or arguments. Flags customize the behavior of a command, and arguments are specific to the command.
