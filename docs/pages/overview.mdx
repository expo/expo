Expo is an [open-source framework](https://github.com/expo/expo/) for apps that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app.

- **Develop**: Developing an app requires writing code in JavaScript/TypeScript. When you create a new project, Expo provides a standard [project structure](/develop/project-structure) which you can customize as per your needs. It also provides [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) that help your team to iterate quickly to achieve web-like iteration speeds and safely.

- **Deploy**: Deploying your app requires you to publish your app to the Play Store and App Store. Expo provides a [build service](/deploy/build-project/) that helps you to build your app for Android and iOS. It also provides ways to automate [uploading and submitting your app binaries](/deploy/submit-to-app-stores) to the app stores, and fixing small bugs and [pushing quick fixes](/deploy/instant-updates) a snap in between app store submissions.

There are plenty of other features and best practices to continue exploring along the way, such as [collaborating with your team](/accounts/account-types/#organizations), using [Expo modules](/versions/latest/), [debugging](/debugging/runtime-issues/), and working on the command line with [Expo CLI](/workflow/expo-cli).
