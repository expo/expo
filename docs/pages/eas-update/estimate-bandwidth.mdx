# Understanding update bandwidth usage

EAS Update enables an app to update its own non-native pieces (such as JS, styling, and images) over-the-air. This guide explains how bandwidth is consumed and optimized.

## Bandwidth calculation breakdown

Each subscription plan includes a predefined bandwidth allocation per billing cycle, which translates to a specific number of updates your users can download. Here's how we estimate bandwidth usage:

- **Update size:** The key factor in bandwidth consumption is the size of update assets that are not already on the device. If an update only modifies the JavaScript portion of your app, users will only download the new Javascript. To begin an example, if the uncompressed Javascript portion is **10 MB**, compression can further reduce its size.
- **Compression ratio:** The level of compression depends on the file type. JavaScript and Hermes bytecode (commonly used in React Native apps) can be compressed, while images and icons are not automatically compressed. In the example above, a Hermes bytecode bundle achieves an estimated **2.6× compression ratio**, reducing the actual download size to:

  ```text
  10 MB / 2.6 ≈ 3.85 MB per update
  ```

- **Total Downloads:** Given a bandwidth allocation, we estimate how many users can download an update. For example, if your plan includes **1 TiB (1,024 GiB) of bandwidth per billing cycle**, the number of updates covered by this allocation is:

  ```text
  (1,024 GiB × 1,024 MiB/GiB) / 3.85 MiB ≈ 272,935 updates
  ```

## Measuring your actual update size

To determine the actual compressed size of your Hermes bundle, run the following command:

```sh
gzip -9 -k bundle.hbc
ls -lh bundle.hbc.gz
```

This will generate a **gzip-compressed** version of your Hermes bundle (`bundle.hbc.gz`) and display its size. You can use this to refine bandwidth calculations based on your app’s real-world update sizes.

## Factors that affect bandwidth consumption

Actual bandwidth usage varies due to:

- **User behavior:** While theoretical calculations assume every user downloads every update, many users only receive updates when reopening the app, meaning they may skip intermediate updates.
- **Missing assets:** Any assets not included in the embedded build but required in the update (e.g., fonts, images, or other dependencies) will need to be downloaded as well, increasing bandwidth usage.

## Best practices to optimize bandwidth usage

1. **Minimize update size:** Avoid bundling unnecessary assets in updates.
2. **Monitor usage:** Check your bandwidth metrics to detect unusual spikes or inefficiencies.
