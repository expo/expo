There are two types of rollbacks supported by EAS Update:

- Roll back to a previously-published update.
- Roll back to the update embedded in the build.

## Start a rollback

To start a rollback, ensure you have EAS CLI version `5.9.0` or above installed. Then, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:rollback']} />

In the terminal, an interactive guide will assist you in selecting the type of rollback and doing the rollback.

## Rolling back to a previously-published update

The above command re-publishes a previously-published update to functionally roll back clients to that update.

## Rolling back to the update embedded in the build

The above command instructs the client to run the update embedded in the build.

## Publishing after the rollback

Upon publishing again after a rollback, all clients will receive the new update.
