There are two types of roll backs supported by EAS Update:
- Roll back to a previously-published update.
- Roll back to the update embedded in the build.

To start a roll back, use `npx eas-cli@latest` or ensure you have `eas-cli` version `5.9.0` or above. Then, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['npx eas-cli@latest update:rollback']} />

In the terminal, an interactive guide will assist you in selecting the type of rollback and doing the rollback.

## Rolling back to a previously-published update

The above command re-publishes a previously-published update to functionally roll-back clients to that update.

## Rolling back to the update embedded in the build

The above command instructs the client to run the update embedded in the build.

## Publishing after the rollback

Upon publishing again after a rollback, all clients will receive the new update.
