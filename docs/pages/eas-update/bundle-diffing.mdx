> **info** Bundle diffing is in **beta** and may have limitations. See [Current limitations](#current-limitations) for details.

Enable bundle diffing to let EAS Update deliver a **bundle patch** when possible. When you publish a new update, EAS Update can generate a smaller file containing only the differences between the bundle currently running on the device and the new bundle. This often reduces update download size significantly.

## Prerequisites

Your app must use **Expo SDK 55 or later**.

## Enable bundle diffing

In your project’s `app.json` or `app.config.js`, set `updates.enableBsdiffPatchSupport` to `true`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "updates": {
      "enableBsdiffPatchSupport": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify bundle diffs are being served

### Expo website

You can confirm that bundle diffs are being served from the [Update Details](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/updates) page. Open the Update Group you published, then select the platform you want to inspect.

### Updates API

You can confirm that bundle diffs are being served by inspecting update logs with `Updates.readLogEntriesAsync()`. If your app received a patch, you will see an entry indicating it was successfully applied (for example, “patch successfully applied”).

## Patch generation and serving

EAS Update uses the [bsdiff algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsdiff) to generate bundle patches.

A patch is served only when:

- **It’s meaningfully smaller than the full bundle.** If it isn't, EAS Update serves the full bundle instead.
- **It can be computed efficiently.** If generating the patch is too resource intensive, EAS Update serves the full bundle instead.

## Current limitations

- **Embedded bundles aren’t eligible.** The embedded bundle is never used as a base for patching. Devices must already be running a published update to receive a patch.
- **Patches are generated shortly after publishing.** It can take a few minutes between publishing an update and the patch being ready. During that window, devices may receive the full bundle.
