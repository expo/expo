Setting up EAS Update allows you to push critical bug fixes and improvements that your users need right away. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up EAS Update in your project.

<Step label="1">
## Install the latest EAS CLI

EAS CLI is the command line app you will use to interact with EAS services from your terminal. To install it, run the command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm install --global eas-cli']} />

You can also use the above command to check if a new version of EAS CLI is available. We encourage you to always stay up to date with the latest version.

> We recommend using `npm` instead of `yarn` for global package installations. You may alternatively use `npx eas-cli@latest`. Remember to use that instead of `eas` whenever it's called for in the documentation.

</Step>

<Step label="2">
## Login to your Expo account

If you are already signed in to an Expo account using Expo CLI, you can skip the steps described in this section. If you are not, run the following command to log in:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas login']} />

You can check whether you are logged in by running `eas whoami`.

</Step>

<Step label="3">
## Create a project

Create a project by running:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app']} />
</Step>

<Step label="4">
## Configure your project

To configure your project, run the following commands in the order they are specified:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Install the latest `expo-updates` library',
    '$ npx expo install expo-updates',
    '',
    '# Initialize your project with EAS Update',
    '$ eas update:configure',
    '',
    '# Set up the configuration file for builds',
    '$ eas build:configure',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="expo install expo-updates && eas update:configure && eas build:configure"
/>

These configuration commands will create an **eas.json** file in your project's root directory and add a channel property for `preview` and `production` build profiles inside the file.

```json eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "channel": "preview"
      // ...
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production"
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

The channel allows you to point updates at builds of that profile. For example, if we set up a GitHub Action to publish changes on merge, we can merge code into the "production" Git branch. Then, each commit will trigger a GitHub Action that will publish an update, which will be available to builds with the channel "production".

> **Optional**: If your project is a bare React Native project, see the [bare React Native updates guide](/bare/installing-updates/) for any additional configuration needed.

</Step>

<Step label="5">
## Create a build for the project

You need to create a build for Android or iOS. We recommend creating a build with the `preview` build profile first. See [Create your first build](/build/setup/) on how to get started and set up [Internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/#setting-up-internal-distribution) for your device or simulator.

Once you have a build running on your device or a simulator, you are ready to send an update.

</Step>

<Step label="6">
## Make changes locally

After creating the build, you are ready to iterate on the project. Start a local development server with the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

Then, make any desired changes to your project's JavaScript, styling, or image assets.

</Step>

<Step label="7">
## Publish an update

Publishing an update allows:

- Fixing bugs and quickly updating non-native parts of a project instead of creating a new build
- [Sharing a preview version of an app](/review/overview/) using internal distribution

To publish an update with changes from your project, use the `eas update` command, and specify a name for the channel and a `message` to describe the update:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --channel [channel-name] --message "[message]"']} />

<Collapsible summary="How does publishing an update work?">

When you publish an update with the `eas update` command, it generates a new update bundle and uploads it to the EAS servers. The channel name is used to locate the correct branch to publish a new update from other update branches. It is similar to how Git commit works, where every commit is on a Git branch.

For example, when an app is set to pull updates from the `preview` channel, you can publish an update for that build with `eas update --channel preview`. This will create a branch (called `preview` by default) on the `preview` channel. Behind the scenes, this command runs `npx expo export` to generate a **dist** directory and create a local update bundle. This update bundle is uploaded to EAS Update servers.

</Step>

<Step label="8">
## Test the update

After the update is uploaded to EAS Update, you can use one of the following methods to test the update:

- Use the Extensions tab in a [development build](/eas-update/expo-dev-client/) to load the update.
- Use [Expo Orbit](/review/with-orbit/) to install and launch the update in a development build.
- Implement a custom strategy with [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) and [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/#updates) to load updates in the app programmatically.
- Manually test the update by force closing and reopening a release build of your app up to two times to download and apply the update. Updates for non-development builds (preview or production) are automatically downloaded to the device in the background when the app starts up and makes a request for any new updates. The update will be applied after it is downloaded and the app is restarted.
