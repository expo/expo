**EAS Update** is a hosted service that serves updates for projects using the [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library.

EAS Update makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by enabling an app to update its own non-native pieces (such as JS, styling, and images) over-the-air.

All apps that include the `expo-updates` library have the ability to receive updates.

- To start using EAS Update, continue to the [Getting Started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.
- For a complete tutorial of using EAS Update with other EAS services, refer to the [EAS Tutorial](/tutorial/eas/introduction/).
