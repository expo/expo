**EAS Update** is a cloud service from EAS (Expo Application Services) that serves updates for projects using the [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) library.

EAS Update makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by enabling an app to update its own non-native pieces (such as JS, styling, and images) over-the-air. All apps that include the `expo-updates` library have the ability to receive updates.

## Quick start

Install the `expo-updates` library and configure EAS Update:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-updates', '', '$ eas update:configure']} />

Push an update to the production channel:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update --channel production --message "Fix login button alignment"']} />

This command publishes your JavaScript bundle and assets so users receive the new version on their next app launch.

For complete steps to start using EAS Update, see [Get started with EAS Update](/eas-update/getting-started/).

## Key features

### JS API for update management

  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

The updates [JavaScript API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) includes a React hook called `useUpdates()`. This hook provides detailed information about the currently running update and any new updates that are available or have been downloaded. In addition, you can view any errors that were encountered during the update process to help you debug any issues while the app is attempting to update.

The API also provides methods such as `checkForUpdateAsync()` and `fetchUpdateAsync()` which allows you to control when your app checks for and downloads updates.

### Insight tracking

/>

You'll get a [deployments dashboard](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[project]/deployments) that helps visualize which updates are being sent to builds. Updates work in concert with [insights](/eas-insights/introduction/) to provide data on the adoption rates of your updates with your users.

### Republish for reverting mistakes

  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

If an update isn't performing as expected, you can [republish](/eas-update/eas-cli/#republish-a-previous-update-within-a-branch) a previous, stable version on top of the problematic one, much like a new "commit" in version control systems.

## Why teams use EAS Update

EAS Update helps teams to:

- Fix a bug or crash in JavaScript code and deploy updates in minutes
- Update copy, translations, UI styling, or screen layouts
- Change configuration values or feature flags
- Roll out changes to a percentage of users using [rollouts](/eas-update/rollouts/)
- Test updates with internal teams before production release

## When not to use EAS Update

EAS Update is not suitable for:

- Changes to native code or native dependencies
- Changes to app permissions (camera, location, and others)
- Updating the Expo SDK version
- Anything that requires a new app binary version

In these cases, use [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) to create and submit a new app binary.

## FAQ

<Collapsible summary="Can I test updates with a small group before releasing to everyone?">

Yes. Use EAS Update with [rollouts](/eas-update/rollouts/) to release to a percentage of users, or use staging [channels](/eas-update/how-it-works/#conceptual-overview) to test with internal teams first.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Update with my existing React Native project?">

Yes. EAS Update works with both projects that use [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) and [existing React Native projects](/bare/installing-updates/) that have the [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library installed.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Do my app users need to reinstall the app to receive updates?">

No. Updates are downloaded inside the app and applied based on your configuration. App users see the new version on their next app launch or reload.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How does EAS Update handle native code compatibility?">

EAS Update uses [runtime version policies](/eas-update/runtime-versions/) to ensure updates are only sent to builds with compatible native code. If your native code changes, you create a new runtime version.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I roll back a bad update?">

Yes. You can roll back updates using `eas update:rollback` to revert to a previous stable update. Learn more in the [Rollback to a previous update](/eas-update/rollbacks/) guide.

<Collapsible summary="What's the difference between EAS Update and CodePush?">

EAS Update is Expo's native solution that also integrates with [EAS Build](/build/introduction/), supports modern Expo features, and provides a unified workflow. CodePush uses a slightly different approach. To learn more about the differences between EAS Update and CodePush, see [Conceptual differences between CodePush and EAS Update](/eas-update/codepush/#conceptual-differences-between-codepush-and-eas-update).
