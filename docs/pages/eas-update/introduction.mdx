**EAS Update** is a hosted service that serves updates for projects using the [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library.

EAS Update makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by enabling an app to update its own non-native pieces (such as JS, styling, and images) over-the-air.

All apps that include the `expo-updates` library have the ability to receive updates.

- To start using EAS Update, continue to the [Getting Started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.
- For a complete tutorial of using EAS Update with other EAS services, refer to the [EAS Tutorial](/tutorial/eas/introduction/).

### Improve user experience

EAS Update allows you to quickly release hotfixes and enhancements in response to user feedback or market trends. It helps you keep users engaged and satisfied with your app. Don't wait for the next planned update or manual update request.

### Tailored for Expo

EAS Update is designed for easy integration with Expo apps. Use the Expo website to see app deployment status and debug issues, and seamlessly integrate with [EAS Build](/build/introduction/).

### Broad compatibility

EAS Update also works with [vanilla React Native apps](/bare/installing-updates/). All you need to do is install the lightweight `expo` npm package as a prerequisite.

### Customizable update strategies

Configure behavior in your app using the [`expo-updates` API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) and [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/#updates). You will always have the upper hand in shaping the update process without compromising your users' experience.
