EAS Update is the next generation of Expo's updates service. If you're using Classic Updates, this guide will help you upgrade to EAS Update.

## Prerequisites

EAS Update requires the following versions or greater:

- Expo CLI >= 5.3.0
- EAS CLI >= 0.50.0
- Expo SDK >= 45.0.0
- expo-updates >= 0.13.0

## Install EAS CLI

1. Install EAS CLI:

   <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install --global eas-cli']} />

2. Then, log in with your expo account:

   <Terminal cmd={['$ eas login']} />

## Configure your project

You'll need to make the following changes to your project:

1. Initialize your project with EAS Update:

   <Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />

   After this command, you should have two a new fields in your app config at `expo.updates.url` and `expo.runtimeVersion`.

2. To ensure that updates are compatible with the underlying native code inside a build, EAS Update uses a new field named `runtimeVersion` that replaces the `sdkVersion` field in your project's app config. Remove the `expo.sdkVersion` property from your app config.

3. To allow updates to apply to builds built with EAS, update your EAS build profiles in **eas.json** to include `channel` properties. These channels should replace any `releaseChannel` properties. We find it convenient to name the `channel` after the profile's name. For instance, the `preview` profile has a `channel` named `"preview"` and the `production` profile has a `channel` named `"production"`.

   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "development": {
         "developmentClient": true,
         "distribution": "internal"
       },
       "preview": {
         "distribution": "internal",
         "channel": "preview"
       },
       "production": {
         "channel": "production"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Optional: If your project is a bare React Native project, [read the doc](/bare/updating-your-app) on extra configuration you may need.

## Create new builds

The changes above affect the native code layer inside builds, which means you'll need to make new builds. Once your builds are complete, you'll be ready to develop an update and publish it.

## Publishing an update

After making a change to your poject locally, you're ready to publish an update, run:

```bash
eas update --branch [branch-name] --message [message]

# Example
eas update --branch production --message "Fixes typo"
```

EAS Update adds a new idea called a "branch". A branch is a list of updates, and it is mapped to a channel. In the diagram below, builds with a channel of "production" are linked to a branch named "production". By default, channels and branches of the same name are linked until changed. By default, this behaves like the Classic Updates service.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt={`Channel "production" linked to branch "production"`}
  src="/static/images/eas-update/channel-branch.png"
/>

## Additional possible migration steps

- Replace instances of `expo publish` with `eas update`. You can view all the options for publishing with `eas update --help`.
- If you have any code that references `Updates.releaseChannel` from the `expo-updates` library, replace them with `Updates.channel`.
- Remove any code that references `Constants.manifest`. That will now always return `null`. If you're using SDK 46 or above, you can access most properties you'll need with `Constants.expoConfig` from the `expo-constants` library.
