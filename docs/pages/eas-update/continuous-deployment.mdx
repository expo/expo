## Prerequisites

- You need to have a GitHub account and use it to host your git project.
- You need to have an Expo token configured in your GitHub repository.

<Collapsible summary="How to configure the EXPO_TOKEN environment variable on your GitHub repository">

- Navigate to [expo.dev/settings/access-tokens](https://expo.dev/settings/access-tokens) and then:
- Click **Create token** to create a new personal access token.
- Copy the generated token.
- Navigate to https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/settings/secrets/actions by replacing "your-username" and "your-repo-name" with your project's info.
- Under **Repository secrets**, click **New repository secret**.
- Create a secret with the name **EXPO_TOKEN**, and paste the copied access token in as the value.

## GitHub Action: continuous-deploy-fingerprint

> **info** This is available in beta for SDK 51 and not yet considered stable. Use may result in unexpected system behavior.

Expo provides a GitHub Action called [continuous-deploy-fingerprint](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action/tree/main/continuous-deploy-fingerprint) to provide CI/CD for a React Native project. It dictates that every JS change (update) is deployed to all compatible builds over-the-air, and new builds are created when the runtime changes.

It is typically accomplished by performing roughly these steps:

1. Run application tests, abort if tests fail (`continuous-deploy-fingerprint` does not currently run tests, you can do configure your workflow to run tests first).
2. Calculate fingerprint for relevant platforms using the `npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate` command.
3. Check for EAS builds with a runtime version equal to the fingerprint (`eas build:list --runtimeVersion <fingerprint>`). Create a new build if none exists yet.
   - (optional) Submit to app stores for full continuous deployment. This has not yet been tested and is not recommended.
4. Run `eas update` to publish an update for the current commit.

### Fingerprint runtime versioning

The [`fingerprint` runtime version policy](/eas-update/runtime-versions/#fingerprint-runtime-version-policy) uses the `@expo/fingerprint` package to generate a hash of your project when making a build or publishing an update, and then uses that hash as the runtime version. The hash is calculated based on dependencies, custom native code, native project files, and configuration, amongst other things.

By automatically calculating the runtime version, you don't have to be concerned about native layer compatibility with the JavaScript application when deploying updates to builds.

<Collapsible summary="How do I debug fingerprint inconsistencies between my local machine and CI/CD?">

If you notice different fingerprints being generated across different machines or environments, it may mean that unanticipated files are being included in the hash calculation. `@expo/fingerprint` has a predetermined set of files to include/exclude for hash calculation, but often your project setup may require additional excludes. For projects that include native directories (**android** and **ios**) this is more common.

We provide tools for identifying which files are causing fingerprint inconsistencies and mechanisms to exclude those files from fingerprint calculations for your project.

To identify differences in fingerprints on different machines or environments:

- When running fingerprint generation commands on each machine/environment (`npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate`), pass `--debug` flag.
- Diff outputs from those command runs to determine files causing the difference. These tools may be helpful:
  - [JSON Pretty Print](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print) to format the output.
  - [JSON Diff](https://www.jsondiff.com/) to compare the output and identify the files causing the discrepancies.

To exclude files causing the differences, add them to the **.fingerprintignore** file as described in the [`@expo/fingerprint` README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/fingerprint).

<Collapsible summary="How do I debug the commands that are run in the workflow?">

Running your GitHub workflows in debug mode will automatically add the `--debug` flag to the commands run as part of the action, and the output will be available in the workflow run logs.

## GitHub Action: expo-github-action

An alternative GitHub action is [expo-github-action](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action/tree/main) that can be used to publish updates on push and previews on pull requests. `continuous-deploy-fingerprint` uses fingerprints to determine if a build is needed or not to deploy an update, while `expo-github-action` will only publish updates.

- To learn about publishing updates when code is pushed to the main branch, refer to the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#create-new-eas-update-on-push-to-main).
- To learn about Pull Request previews with `expo-github-action`, refer to the [GitHub PR Previews guide](/eas-update/github-actions/).
