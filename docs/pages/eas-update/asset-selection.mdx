> **info** Available for SDK 50 and above ([`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates/) >= 0.23.0).

In SDK 49 and earlier, all assets resolved in the Metro bundler are included in every update and are uploaded to the update server. The new experimental asset selection feature in SDK 50 allows the developer to specify that only certain assets should be included in updates. This can greatly reduce the number of assets that need to be uploaded to and downloaded from the updates server. This feature will work with the EAS Update server or any custom server that complies with the [`expo-updates` protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1).

To use this feature, include the new property `extra.updates.assetPatternsToBeBundled` in your app config. It should define one or more file-matching patterns (regular expressions). For example, suppose your **app.json** file has the patterns defined this way:

```json app.json
  "expo": {
    /* @hide ... your existing configuration */ /* @end */
    "extra": {
      "updates": {
        "assetPatternsToBeBundled": [
          "app/images/**/*.png"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

In this case, all **.png** files in all subdirectories of **app/images** will be included in updates.

Assets that do not match any of the file patterns will still resolve in the Metro bundler, but will not be uploaded to the updates server. If making use of this feature, a developer needs to be certain that assets not included in updates are built into the native build of the app.

If this new property is not in your app config, all assets resolved by the bundler will be included in updates (as per SDK 49 and earlier behavior).
