[`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) library allows launching different versions of a project by creating a development build. Any compatible EAS Update can be previewed in a development build.

This guide walks through the steps required to load and preview a published update inside a development build using the **Extensions** tab or constructing a specific Update URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a development build and install it](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) on your device or Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.
- Make sure your development build has the [`expo-updates` library installed](/eas-update/getting-started/#configure-your-project).

## What is an Extensions tab

When using the `expo-updates` library inside a development build, the **Extensions** tab provides the ability to load and preview a published update automatically.

### Preview an update using the Extensions tab

<Step label="1">

Make non-native changes locally in your project and then [publish them using `eas update`](/eas-update/publish/). The update will be published on a branch.

</Step>

<Step label="2">

After publishing the update, open your development build, go to **Extensions**, and tap **Login** to log in to your Expo account within the development build. This step is required for the **Extensions** tab to load any published updates associated with the project under your Expo account.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

After logging in, an EAS Update section will appear inside the **Extensions** tab with one or more of the latest published updates. Tap **Open** next to the update you want to previous.

</Step>

In the **Extensions** tab, you can view the list of all published updates for a branch. Tap the branch name in the **Extensions** tab.

## Preview an update using the Expo dashboard

You can also preview an update using the Expo dashboard by following the steps below:

- Click the published updated link in the CLI after running the command to publish an update. This will open the update's details on the **Updates** page in the Expo dashboard.
- Under **Platform-specific updates**, select the platform on which you want to preview the update and click **Preview**. This will open the **Preview** modal.
- In the **Preview** modal, add your project's [`slug`](/versions/latest/config/app/#slug) under **App slug**.
- To preview the update, you can either scan the QR code with your device's camera or copy the URL and paste it into the development build's launcher screen under **Enter URL Manually**.

## Construct an update URL

As an alternative to the methods described in the previous sections, you can construct a specific URL to open your EAS Update in the development build. The URL will look like the following:

```bash
exp+[project-slug]://expo-development-client/?url=[https://u.expo.dev/project-id]?channel-name=[channel]

# Example
exp+my-app://expo-development-client/?url=https://u.expo.dev/675cb1f0-fa3c-11e8-ac99-6374d9643cb2?channel-name=development
```

Let's break this URL to understand what each part does:

| Part of URL                                               | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exp+`                                                    | The beginning of the URL.                                                              |
| `form-duo`                                                | This is the project [slug](/versions/latest/config/app/#slug) found in the app config. |
| `://expo-development-client/`                             | Necessary for the deep link to work with the `expo-dev-client` library.                |
| `?url=`                                                   | Defines a `url` query parameter.                                                       |
| `https://u.expo.dev/675cb1f0-fa3c-11e8-ac99-6374d9643cb2` | This is the updates URL, which is inside the project's app config under `updates.url`. |
| `?channel-name=`                                          | Defines a channel query parameter.                                                     |
| `development`                                             | The name of the channel to request.                                                    |

Once you've constructed the URL, copy and paste it directly into the development build's launcher screen under **Enter URL Manually**.

Alternatively, you can create a QR code for the URL and scan it using your device's camera. When scanned, the URL will open up the development build to the specified channel.
