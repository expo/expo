### How can I implement a custom update strategy for my app

By default, `expo-updates` checks for updates every time the app is loaded. You can implement a custom update strategy with the [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) and [app config](/versions/latest/config/app/#updates).

### What guidelines must I follow when publishing updates

One of the rules of EAS Update is that you need to follow the rules of the platforms and app stores you are building for. This means your updates need to follow the App Store and Play Store guidelines, including the content of the updates and how you use them. This usually means changes to your app's behavior need to be reviewed.

App Store rules regularly change and just like how you might need to follow them if you were writing an app without Expo, you need to follow them when you are using Expo and EAS Update.

EAS Update is a great way to quickly deliver improvements to the people who use your apps. For example, consider an app that has a critical bug that needs to be fixed. With EAS Update you can quickly get the fix out and later follow up with a new submission that includes the fix built in.

### Are Classic Updates still supported

The Classic Updates service, which has been available before December 2021, is now deprecated. Users can no longer run `expo publish`, but existing apps will continue to receive Classic Updates that have already been published and are actively used.

We recommend users transition to EAS Update or use a [self-hosted update service](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/custom-updates-server).
