EAS Update works great as a standalone service, so you can use it with or without EAS Build and other EAS services. All of the main features of EAS Update are designed to be agnostic of the build pipeline and are used in production by large organizations that do not use other EAS services.

That said, many organizations are already heavily invested in their CI/CD infrastructure or may have other reasons for wanting to use another build pipeline, and the benefits offered by deeper integration across EAS services may not be worth the switching costs of migrating to a different CI/CD provider.

<Collapsible summary="What are the downsides of using EAS Update without other EAS services?">

EAS Update and Build work closely together to provide an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, when you create a build with EAS Build we will help with the bookkeeping for various aspects related to updates, such as the runtime version, the channel, and its fingerprint. Builds that use the same channel and runtime version are grouped into a "Deployments" section, and this works as a dashboard to monitor the progress of update adoption. These sorts of bookkeeping and insights features that depend on knowledge of builds or other aspects of your app won't be available if you use EAS Update independently of other EAS services.

## Using EAS Update without EAS Build

Most of the [installation and configuration steps](/eas-update/getting-started) are identical whether you are using EAS Build or not. The primary difference is that you will need to configure the update [channel](/eas-update/eas-cli/) manually.

An update channel is a string, such as `preview` or `production`, that indicates which stream a build should pull updates from. A build can only point to a single channel. If you create a build with EAS Build, the channel from **eas.json** will be automatically configured. If you're not using ESA Build, you'll need to add it to either your **app.json** or **AndroidManifest.xml** and **Expo.plist**. [Learn how to configure the update channel](/eas-update/getting-started/#configure-the-update-channel).
