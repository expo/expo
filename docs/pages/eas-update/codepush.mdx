This guide explains how to transition a React Native project that uses CodePush to use EAS Update which offers [many advantages](/eas-update/introduction/#pitch). It assumes that you're using the default React Native project structure. For assistance with migrating brownfield native apps to EAS Update, [reach out to us directly](https://expo.dev/contact).

To learn more about the differences between CodePush and EAS Update, see [Conceptual differences between CodePush and EAS Update](#conceptual-differences-between-codepush-and-eas-update) and the [What to do without CodePush post on the Expo Blog](https://expo.dev/blog/what-to-do-without-codepush).

<Step label="1">
## Uninstall CodePush

To avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior, it's recommended to uninstall CodePush if you're using EAS Update. This is because your app could periodically fetch updates from both services, leading to issues, especially if you're using different configurations for each service.

Remove the CodePush SDK from your project by uninstalling the `react-native-code-push` package:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm uninstall react-native-code-push']} />

You'll also need to remove CodePush references from JS and native code. See this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/1101#issuecomment-350204507) for more detailed instructions.

</Step>

<Step label="2">
## Add an `expo` key to your `app.json`

Ensure that your project has an **app.json** file with an `expo` object. If you don't have anything specific to configure in your **app.json** file yet, you can create a minimal file with an empty `expo` object like this:

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    //... any other existing keys you have
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">
## Follow the "Getting Started" guide

The instructions in the [EAS Update Getting Started guide](/eas-update/getting-started/) will guide you through setting up EAS Update in your project.

</Step>

<Step label="4">
## Resubmit your app

Since you have changed the update provider from CodePush to EAS Update, you will need to rebuild your app and submit the new build to the respective app stores (Google Play Store and Apple App Store) to ensure the update mechanism works as expected for your end-users.

Follow the respective store guidelines for submitting a new build of your application:

- [Submitting to Apple App Store](/submit/ios)
- [Submitting to Google Play Store](/submit/android)

After successfully submitting your app, users will be able to download and use the latest build with EAS Update integration. If your app is not updating as expected, [validate your configuration](/eas-update/debug).

</Step>

## Common questions

<Collapsible summary="How do I release mandatory/critical updates with EAS Update?">

CodePush CLI has a `--mandatory` flag that allows you to release mandatory updates. You can build this functionality with EAS Update but there is no specific flag for it.

[Learn more about mandatory/critical updates](/eas-update/critical-updates).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How do I include a message in an update?">

CodePush CLI has a `--description` flag that allows you to include a message in an update. You can build this functionality with EAS Update using the `extra` field in your app config.

[Learn more about adding a message to an update](/eas-update/update-metadata).

<Collapsible summary="How do I switch the 'deployment' that is being used at runtime?">

**In production environments**, we recommend using channels and branches to control which update is routed to specific builds. Using this mechanism provides the safest experience for updating your app, because it ensures that you can roll back to the previous version if the new update crashes.

**In preview environments**, it is possible to specify which update you would like to load by overriding the URL and/or channel configuration. [Learn more](/eas-update/previews/).

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="How do I handle different environments (staging/production) with EAS Update?">

With EAS Update, instead of switching deployments at runtime like in CodePush, you use channels and branches:

- Create different channels (e.g., 'production', 'staging')
- Build your app targeting specific channels
- Use branches to manage different versions of your code
- Control which branch maps to which channel through the EAS server

For example:
- Production builds point to the 'production' channel
- Staging builds point to the 'staging' channel
- Your 'main' branch can be mapped to 'production'
- Your 'staging' branch can be mapped to 'staging'

<Collapsible summary="How do I roll back updates with EAS Update?">

In CodePush, you could roll back to a previous release using the CLI. With EAS Update, you have two options:

1. **Republish a previous update:**
   ```bash
   eas update:republish
   ```

2. **Change the branch mapping:**
   Point your channel to a different branch that contains the stable version of your code.

Both methods are effective ways to quickly revert problematic updates.

<Collapsible summary="What's different about the update checking process?">

With CodePush, you had fine-grained control over when and how updates were checked and downloaded using methods like `sync()` and various options. EAS Update handles this differently:

- Updates are automatically checked on app launch
- The update checking process is managed by the EAS Update runtime
- You can manually check for updates using `checkForUpdateAsync()`
- You have less granular control over the update checking process, but it's simpler to implement

## Conceptual differences between CodePush and EAS Update

CodePush and EAS Update are both services that allow you to send hotfixes to the JavaScript code of your app, but they take slightly different approaches, and so you may need to adapt your release process when moving to EAS Update.

<Collapsible summary="Differences in how updates are organized within streams">

**CodePush has single streams of updates for deployments**. What this means is that you can point a build to a deployment, and it will pull updates from that. If you want to change the deployment that is targeted by a build, you can do this at runtime through a JavaScript API.

**EAS Update has multiple streams of updates** â€” one that correspond to your source control branches (called branches), and another called channels, which point to branches. The mapping between channels and branches is handled on the server side, and a channel can point to different branches for each runtime version (additionally, more advanced logic may be expressed, such as to support incremental rollouts). Builds are not directly associated with branches, but rather with channels. Each build points to a single channel, which is set at build time and cannot be modified at runtime. The reason for this is that it ensures that certain branches (eg: development, staging) don't automatically go out to production &mdash; your preview updates don't go to your production users. This helps you separate the two main uses of EAS Update: previews and production hotfixes.

<Collapsible summary="Differences in how updates are selected at runtime">

A key distinction between CodePush and EAS Update that can impact your release process is that **with CodePush, the client controls the target update deployment at runtime**, and **with EAS Update, it is controlled on the server side, by mapping channels to branches**. This means that you can't include code in your app using EAS Update to instruct it to load a different stream of updates depending on runtime criteria, such as the current user role (eg: distribute beta releases to employees) - it will only load the branch that is mapped on EAS Update servers to the corresponding channel (such as production or staging).

The ability to control the target deployment at runtime is commonly used with CodePush in staging environments to allow non-technical stakeholders to test features from a single build on Google Play Beta / TestFlight. The current alternative for this with EAS Update is to use [development builds](/eas-update/expo-dev-client/). We're currently working on providing a way to do this with release builds.
