title: Using EAS Update with EAS CLI
---

import ImageSpotlight from '~/components/plugins/ImageSpotlight';

EAS Update works by linking _branches_ to _channels_. Channels are specified at build time and exist inside a build's native code. Branches are an ordered list of updates, similar to a Git branch, which is an ordered list of commits. With EAS Update, we can link any channel to any branch, allowing us to make different updates available to different builds.

<ImageSpotlight
  alt={`Channel "production" linked to branch "version-1.0"`}
  src="/static/images/eas-update/channel-branch-link.png"
/>

The diagram above visualizes this link. Here, we have the builds with the "production" channel linked to the branch named "version-1.0". When we're ready, we can adjust the channel–branch pointer. Imagine we have more fixes tested and ready on a branch named "version-2.0". We could update this link to make the "version-2.0" branch available to all builds with the "production" channel.

## Inspecting the state of your project's updates

### Inspect channels

View all channels:

```bash
eas channel:list
```

View a specific channel:

```bash
eas channel:view [channel-name]

# Example
eas channel:view production
```

Create a channel:

```bash
eas channel:create [channel-name]

# Example
eas channel:create production
```

### Inspect branches

See all branches:

```bash
eas branch:list
```

See a specific branch and a list of its updates:

```bash
eas branch:view [branch-name]

# Example
eas branch:view version-1.0
```

### Inspect updates

View a specific update:

```bash
eas update:view [update-group-id]

# Example
eas update:view dbfd479f-d981-44ce-8774-f2fbcc386aa
```

## Changing the state of your project's updates

### Create a new update and publish it

```bash
eas update --branch [branch-name] --message "..."

# Example
eas update --branch version-1.0 --message "Fixes typo"
```

If you're using Git, we can use the `--auto` flag to auto-fill the branch name and the message. This flag will use the current Git branch as the branch name and the latest Git commit message as the message.

```bash
eas update --branch
```

### Delete a branch

```bash
eas branch:delete [branch-name]

# Example
eas branch:delete version-1.0
```

### Rename a branch

Renaming branches does not disconnect any channel–branch links. If you had a channel named "production" linked to a branch named "version-1.0", and then you renamed the branch named "version-1.0" to "version-1.0-new", the "production" channel would be linked to the now-renamed branch "version-1.0-new".

```bash
eas branch:rename --from [branch-name] --to [branch-name]

# Example
eas branch:rename --from version-1.0 --to version-1.0-new
```

### Republish a previous update within a branch

We can make a previous update immediately available to all users. This command takes the previous update and publishes it again so that it becomes the most current update on the branch. As your users re-open their apps, the apps will see the newly re-published update and will download it.

> Republish is similar to a Git reversion, where the correct commit is placed on top of the Git history.

```bash
eas update --branch [branch-name] --republish --group [update-group-id]

# Example
eas update --branch version-1.0 --republish --group dbfd479f-d981-44ce-8774-f2fbcc386aa
```
