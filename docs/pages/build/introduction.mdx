**EAS Build** is a hosted Expo Application Services (EAS) service that builds app binaries for your Expo and React Native projects.

EAS Build makes building your apps for distribution simple and easy to automate by providing defaults that work well for Expo and React Native projects out of the box, and by handling your app signing credentials for you (if you wish). It also makes sharing builds with your team easier than ever with [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/) (using [ad hoc](/build/internal-distribution/) and/or enterprise "universal" provisioning), deeply integrates with EAS Submit for app store submissions, and has first-class support for the [`expo-updates`](/build/updates/) library.

EAS Build is also designed to work for any native project, whether or not you use Expo and React Native. It's the fastest way to get from `npx create-expo-app` or `npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init` to app stores.

## Quick start

To build your app, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --platform all']} />

This command sends your project to EAS Build and produces installable binaries for Android and iOS. For complete setup instructions, see [Create your first build](/build/setup/).

## Key features

- Cloud builds for Android and iOS with consistent environments
- Manage app signing credentials or use your own
- Shareable [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/) builds with a URL
- Automate builds with build profiles in **eas.json** and integrations with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/) or CI pipelines
- Auto-submit successful builds to app stores via [`--auto-submit`](/build/automate-submissions/) and EAS Submit
- First-class [`expo-updates` integration](/build/updates/) with per-profile channels and runtime version guidance
- Faster builds via [dependency caching and custom cache paths](/build-reference/caching/)

## Frequently asked questions

<Collapsible summary="How do I share builds with my team before submitting to app stores?">

Use [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution/) to share builds with a URL. Set `"distribution": "internal"` in your build profile in **eas.json** to generate installable Android Package (APK) files for Android or [ad hoc builds](/build/internal-distribution/) for iOS.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Build with existing React Native projects?">

Yes. You can use EAS Build with existing React Native projects created with `npx react-native init` or similar tools. See [Overview of using Expo with existing React Native apps](/bare/overview/) for more information.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Does EAS Build handle app signing credentials?">

Yes. You can let EAS Build generate and manage Android [keystores](/app-signing/app-credentials/#android), iOS [provisioning profiles](/app-signing/app-credentials/#ios) and [distribution certificates](/app-signing/app-credentials/#ios), or you can provide your own. See [App signing credentials](/app-signing/app-credentials/) for more information.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I run builds locally instead of in the cloud?">

Yes. Use [local builds](/build-reference/local-builds/) with `eas build --local` to run builds on your machine. This is useful for debugging or for security policies that require local builds.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible summary="Can I use EAS Build with EAS Workflows or CI pipelines?">

Yes. EAS Build integrates with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/get-started/) using the `build` job type. Add a build job to your workflow configuration, for example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build_ios:
    type: build
    params:
      platform: ios
```

You can build for both platforms or make builds conditional based on the branch:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    type: build
    params:
      platform: all
      profile: ${{ github.ref_name == 'main' && 'production' || 'preview' }}
```

For more information and other usage examples, see the [EAS Workflows build job](/eas/workflows/pre-packaged-jobs#build).

You can also configure [builds from GitHub](/build/building-from-github/) and use [building on CI](/build/building-on-ci/) with any provider.

<Collapsible summary="What build server infrastructure does EAS Build use?">

Android builds run on Linux runners hosted in Google Cloud Platform, and iOS builds run on macOS runners hosted in Expo's macOS cloud. See [Build server infrastructure](/build-reference/infrastructure/).
