**EAS Build** is a hosted service for building app binaries for your Expo and React Native projects.

It makes building your apps for distribution super easy by providing defaults that work well for Expo and React Native projects out of the box, and by handling your app signing credentials for you (if you wish). It also makes sharing builds with your team easier than ever with [internal distribution](internal-distribution.md) (using ad hoc and/or enterprise "universal" provisioning), deeply integrates with EAS Submit for app store submissions, and has first-class support for the [`expo-updates`](updates.md) library to send updates.

It's the next generation of the [`expo build:[ios/android]`](/distribution/building-standalone-apps.md) command &mdash; designed to work for any native project, whether or not you also use the managed workflow.

### Get started

- [Creating your first build](setup.md): it should only take a few minutes in total to get up and running for iOS and/or Android.
- [Learning about the limitations](/build-reference/limitations.md): EAS Build is a brand new and rapidly evolving service. It can't do everything yet, so we recommend getting familiar with the current limitations and checking back occasionally.
