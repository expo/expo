Expo Orbit for macOS makes it faster to install and run builds from EAS, local files, or run Snack projects, on simulators and physical devices.

<Video file="orbit/basic-features.mp4" />

Before Orbit, installing builds from EAS (Android and iOS physical devices or emulator/simulator) or running Snack projects on simulators was manual. You had to run `eas build:run` command and select a build for your chosen device or download the archive and then drag and drop it to the simulator (in the case of iOS). Also, for Snack projects, additional steps included installing Expo Go on the virtual device, logging in, and then selecting the Snack from the list. Orbit makes all of these steps as seamless as possible.

## Highlights

- List and launch simulators, including running Android emulators without audio.
- Install and launch builds from EAS to your simulators and real devices in one click.
- Launch Snack projects in your simulators in one click.
- Install and launch apps from local files using Finder or drag and drop a file into the menu bar app. Orbit supports any Android **.apk**, iOS Simulator compatible **.app**, or ad hoc signed apps.
- See pinned projects from your EAS dashboard and quickly launch your latest builds.

## Installation

You can download Orbit with Homebrew, or directly from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/expo/orbit/releases).

<Terminal cmd={['$ brew install expo-orbit']} />

If you want Orbit to start when you log in automatically, click on the Orbit icon in the menu bar, then **Settings** and select the **Launch on Login** option.

> **info** Orbit relies on the Android SDK and `xcrun` for device management, which requires setting up both [Android Studio](/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) and [Xcode](/workflow/ios-simulator/).

Right now, Orbit is compatible only with macOS. However, we have exciting plans to integrate it further into the Expo ecosystem and add even more features. Try out Expo Orbit now, explore its capabilities, and share your feedback.
