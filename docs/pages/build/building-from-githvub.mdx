This guide explains how to trigger builds directly from your GitHub repository using the Expo GitHub App.

## Prerequisites

### Set the `image` field in your eas.json

For the build profiles you want to use with GitHub, specify an [`image`](/eas/json/#image) to use for the native platform in **eas.json**.

Use the `latest` image if your project's configuration does not rely on a specific [build image](/build-reference/infrastructure/). For example:

```json eas.json
{
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "image": "latest"
      },
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Run a successful build from your local machine

To trigger EAS builds from a GitHub repo, you'll need to configure your project for EAS Build and successfully run a build from your computer for each platform that you'd like to support on GitHub.

If you haven't successfully run `eas build -p [all|ios|android]` yet, see [Create your first build](/build/setup/) for more information. Once you have, continue with the steps in this guide.

The following must also be true:

- An Expo user in the organization must have a linked GitHub user with access to the target repository. Check [User settings > Connections](https://expo.dev/settings#connections) and verify that your GitHub user account is linked.
- You must accept the permissions requested by the [Expo GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/installations).

## Configure your app for GitHub

### Link your GitHub repository to your Expo project

Visit your project's [GitHub settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/github).

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The project GitHub settings page"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/project-github-page.png"
/>

Install the Expo GitHub App on your GitHub account.

> **Note:** You must have [Owner or Admin access](/accounts/account-types/#manage-access) of the Expo account to install the app.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The GitHub app installation UI"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/install-github-app.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

Then, link the GitHub repository to your Expo project.

> **Note:** You can only link [GitHub organization repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) to Expo organizations.

<ContentSpotlight

  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/connect-a-repository.png"
  className="max-w-[600px]"
/>

To add a repository from a different GitHub account, click the **Add new account** option in the account selector dropdown.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The account selector on the Expo project GitHub settings page"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/add-new-account.png"
  className="max-w-[320px]"
/>

### Configure your repository settings

Before you run a build, the Expo GitHub App needs to know where to find the source code for your project. If your Expo
project source code is in the root of your repository, then you don't need to do anything. If your
Expo project source code is in a subdirectory, then you'll need to configure "Base directory"
settings for your repository on your project's [GitHub settings
page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/github).

<ContentSpotlight

/>

## Trigger a build from GitHub

Once you have configured your app for GitHub, you can trigger a build from GitHub by using the UI on your project's build list page or by labels on your GitHub PRs.

### Build using the Expo website

Visit your project's [build list
page](https://expo.dev/accounts/[account]/projects/[projectName]/builds) and click the "Build from
GitHub" button. You'll be prompted to select a Git ref (branch/commit/tag), a platform to build
for, and the build profile to apply to it.

You can also specify a base directory for this specific build. That will not change the global
settings for this project.

  alt="The build from GitHub UI on the Expo project builds list page"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/github-build-ui.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

### Build using GitHub PR labels

You can trigger a build from a GitHub PR by adding a label to the PR. The label must be in the form
of `eas-build-[platform]:[profile]` where `[platform]` is either `android`, `ios`, or `all` and
`[profile]` is the name of a build profile specified in your **eas.json** file. If you don't specify
a build platform, it will default to `all`. If you don't specify
a build profile, it will default to `production`.

For example, if
you want to trigger a production build for Android, add the label `eas-build-android` to the PR.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="A PR with the eas-build label and live status checks"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/eas-build-label.png"
/>

The build will be triggered for the latest commit on the PR's base branch. You can view the status
of the build in the PR's checks. A link to the build will be available in the check's details.

/>

### Build automatically when code is pushed to repository

You can take your build automation further by automatically building your Expo project when you push code to GitHub.

#### Set up build triggers

You can set up build triggers to configure when EAS builds your app from GitHub. We allow you to build when pushing to a branch, pull request, and Git tag.

Open your Expo project in the dashboard. To create a build trigger, scroll down to the **Build
triggers** section of the project GitHub settings page and click **New Build Trigger**.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The build triggers section on the Expo project GitHub settings page"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/empty-build-triggers-table.png"
/>

When you click **New Build Trigger**, you will be presented with a form to configure how this build should run.

These patterns can include wildcards represented by asterisks (`*`), which can match any character and number of characters inside the pattern. For example, `releases/*` can match `releases/`, `release/1234`, `release/genesis`, and so on. If you specify the pattern as a sole asterisk (`*`), all branches/tags will be matched.

  alt="The default state of the new build trigger form"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/empty-build-trigger-form.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

You can also configure triggers for specific platforms and build profiles. If you select multiple
platforms, a separate trigger will be made for each.

<ContentSpotlight

  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/filled-build-trigger-form.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The build triggers section on the Expo project GitHub settings page filled with build triggers"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/filled-build-triggers-table.png"
/>

When you push to a branch or tag, you can find the builds by looking at a commit's **Checks** section.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The GitHub checks section on a branch commit"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/builds-executed-automatically-on-branch.png"
  className="max-w-[600px]"
/>

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The GitHub checks section on a tag commit"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/tag-triggered-build.png"
/>

For pull requests, you can configure a **target branch pattern**. This is the destination branch of the pull request you want to build. The same rules apply for wildcards here as well.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The build trigger form for pull request"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/pull-request-trigger-form.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

When you push to a pull request with a source and target branch matching this trigger, you'll find
these builds in the checks section of the pull request:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The GitHub checks section on a pull request"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/pull-request-triggered-build.png"
/>

> **Note:** To trigger builds from a pull request, the pull request's author must be a collaborator
> on the GitHub repository. If you want to build pull requests from external contributors, [apply a PR Label](#build-using-github-pr-labels).

#### Manage build triggers

On your project's GitHub settings page in the Expo dashboard, you can click the options button to the right of
a build trigger row to disable, edit, or delete the trigger.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The options button on the build trigger row"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/edit-trigger-option.png"
  className="max-w-[320px]"
/>

You can also run a GitHub build with the parameters from the trigger manually. This will not count towards your automatic build trigger record.

#### Automatic app stores submission with EAS Submit

Once your build completes, you can automatically submit your app to the app stores using EAS Submit. This feature streamlines the process, reducing the manual steps required to publish your app.

To enable automatic submission, you need to configure your build triggers to include submission as part of the build process. Here's how you can set it up:

- Navigate to your project's GitHub settings page on the Expo dashboard.
- Find the build trigger you want to modify, and click the options button.
- Select **Edit trigger** and in the dialog that appears, check the option **Submit to store after build**.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="The EAS Submit form fields on the trigger edit form"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/eas-submit-form-fields.png"
  className="max-w-[640px]"
/>

- Save your changes.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="An enabled build trigger with automatic submission enabled"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/auto-submit-trigger-column.png"
  className="max-w-[400px]"
/>

Once enabled, every time a build is triggered from this configuration, it will automatically be submitted to the app stores you have configured in your **eas.json** under the `submit` field.

> **Note:** Ensure that your **eas.json** is properly configured for submission, including specifying the correct app store's credentials and submission profile. For more information, see the [EAS Submit](/submit/eas-json/).

### Troubleshooting

- When things go wrong, we will comment on the commit we attempted to build with some error information. We also show the latest result in the build triggers UI, which includes error information when you hover the **Error** tag.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Status UI on the build trigger UI"
  src="/static/images/eas-build/build-from-github/trigger-troubleshooting-status.png"
  className="max-w-[200px]"
/>

- Double check everything in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section is true when trying to build.
- Confirm that your base directory is accurate if you're using a monorepo setup.
- Is your build profile correct? If a matching profile can't be found in **eas.json**, the build will not dispatch.
