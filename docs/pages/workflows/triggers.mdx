Triggers define when a workflow should kick off. When its conditions are met, the workflow will start.

## On push

You can trigger a workflow on a push to a GitHub branch with the `push` trigger.

```yaml .eas/workflows/hello-world.yaml
name: Hello World

on:
  push:
	  branches:
	    - 'main'
	    - 'feature/**'
	    # other branches names and globs

jobs:
  # ...
```

## On pull request

You can trigger a workflow on a pull request with the `pull_request` trigger.

```yaml .eas/workflows/hello-world.yaml
name: Hello World

on:
  pull_request:
	  branches:
		  - 'main'
		  # other branch names and globs

jobs:
  # ...
```

## More

Workflows also support triggering on all branches, on both push and pull request events:

```yaml .eas/workflows/hello-world.yaml
name: Hello World

on:
	push: {} # this will default to `branches: ['*']`, meaning "run on all branches"
	pull_request: {}

jobs:
  # ...
```
