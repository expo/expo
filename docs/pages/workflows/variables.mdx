Variables can be used in workflows to pass data between jobs or steps. They are useful for conditionals on subsequent jobs or affecting the output of a workflow.

You can set variables in the workflow file with the `set-output` function:

```yaml .eas/workflows/variables.yaml
jobs:
  fingerprint:
    outputs:
      # @info Sets the <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> as a variable #
      fingerprint_hash_for_workflow: ${{ steps.fingerprint_step.outputs.fingerprint_hash }}
      # @end #
    steps:
      - uses: eas/checkout
      - uses: eas/install_node_modules
      - name: Install additional tools
        run: sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y jq
      - name: fingerprint
        id: fingerprint_step
        # @info Exposes the <CODE>fingerprint</CODE> variable to other steps in this job. Also exposes the <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> variable. #
        outputs: [fingerprint_hash_for_workflow, fingerprint]
        # @end #
        # @info Sets the <CODE>fingerprint</CODE> and <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> variables #
        run: |
          FINGERPRINT=$(npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios)
          set-output fingerprint $FINGERPRINT
          echo "Fingerprint: $FINGERPRINT"
          FINGERPRINT_HASH=$(echo $FINGERPRINT | jq -r '.hash')
          echo "Fingerprint hash: $FINGERPRINT_HASH"
          set-output fingerprint_hash_for_workflow $FINGERPRINT_HASH
        # @end #
      - name: Print fingerprint
        # @info Accesses the <CODE>fingerprint</CODE> variable #
        run: echo ${{ steps.fingerprint_step.outputs.fingerprint }}
        # @end #
  existing_build:
    needs: [fingerprint]
    type: get-build
    params:
      # @info Accesses the <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> variable #
      fingerprint_hash: ${{ needs.fingerprint.outputs.fingerprint_hash_for_workflow }}
      # @end #
  decide:
    needs: [existing_build]
    steps:
      - name: decide
        run: |
          BUILD_ID="${{ needs.existing_build.outputs.build_id || '' }}"
          echo $BUILD_ID

          if [ -z "${BUILD_ID}" ] || [ "${BUILD_ID}" = "undefined" ]; then
            echo "No build found. Should build."
            exit 0
          fi

          echo "Found build: https://expo.dev/uuid/$BUILD_ID"
          echo "More about build: ${{ toJSON(needs.existing_build.outputs) }}"
```

In the example above, three things are happening:

- The `set-output` function sets the `fingerprint` and `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow` variables.
- The `outputs` keyword on the step inside the `fingerprint` job exposes the `fingerprint` variable to other steps in `fingerprint` job. That variable is used in an `echo` statement later in the job.
- The `outputs` keyword on the `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow` job specifies that the whole workflow will have access to a variable called `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow`. That variable is later used in the `existing_build` job to check if there are any existing builds with the same fingerprint.
