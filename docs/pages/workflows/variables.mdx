Variables can be used in workflows to pass data between jobs or steps. They are useful for conditionals on subsequent jobs or affecting the output of a workflow.

You can set variables in the workflow file with the `set-output` function:

```yaml .eas/workflows/variables.yaml
jobs:
  fingerprint:
    outputs:
      # @info Sets the <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> as a variable #
      fingerprint_hash_for_workflow: ${{ steps.fingerprint_step_id.outputs.fingerprint_hash }}
      # @end #
    steps:
      - name: Set fingerprint hash
        id: fingerprint_step_id
        # @info Exposes the <CODE>fingerprint_hash</CODE> variable to other steps in this job #
        outputs: [fingerprint_hash]
        # @end #
        # @info Sets the <CODE>fingerprint_hash</CODE> as a variable #
        run: |
          FINGERPRINT_HASH=$(npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios | jq '.hash')
          set-output fingerprint_hash $FINGERPRINT_HASH
        # @end #
      - name: Do something with the fingerprint hash
        # @info Accesses the <CODE>fingerprint_hash</CODE variable #
        run: |
          echo ${{ steps.fingerprint_step_id.outputs.fingerprint_hash }}
        # @end #
    maybe_build:
      needs: [fingerprint]
      # @info Accesses the <CODE>fingerprint_hash_for_workflow</CODE> variable #
      if: ${{ needs.fingerprint.outputs.fingerprint_hash_for_workflow != '1234' }}
      # @end #
      type: build
      params:
        platform: ios
```

In the example above, three things are happening:

- The `set-output` function sets the `fingerprint_hash` variable.
- The `outputs` keyword on the step inside the `fingerprint` job exposes the `fingerprint_hash` variable to other steps in `fingerprint` job. That variable is used in an `echo` statement later in the job.
- The `outputs` keyword on the `fingerprint` job specifies that the whole workflow will have access to a variable called `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow`. That variable is later used in the `maybe_build` job to conditionally run the build job.
