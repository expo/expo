Once your app is released, you can track anonymized usage data to give you insights on how users use your app. This data includes which updates are in use, when users experience bugs, and more.

## Expo Insights

Expo provides the [`expo-insights`](/eas-insights/introduction/) library, which tracks information related to [EAS Update](/deploy/send-over-the-air-updates/). This data includes the app version, platform, OS version, and update adoption.

You can install `expo-insights` with:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-insights']} />

After you install it and release production builds on the app stores, you'll be able to see additional data on your project dashboard:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Active user insights on the Expo dashboard."
  src="/static/images/monitoring/monitor-your-app/expo-insights.png"
/>

You can learn more about insights with our [EAS Insights guide](/eas-insights/introduction/).

## LogRocket

You can get more insights with [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com). LogRocket records user sessions and identifies bugs as your users use your app. You can filter sessions by update IDs and also connect to your LogRocket account on the Expo dashboard to get quick acccess to your app's session data.

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="User sessions on the LogRocket dashboard."
