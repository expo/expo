Once your app is released, you can track anonymized usage data to give you insights on how users use your app. This data includes which updates are in use, when users experience bugs, and more.

## Expo insights

Expo provides the [`expo-insights`](/eas-insights/introduction/) library, which tracks information related to [EAS Update](/deploy/send-over-the-air-updates/). This data includes the app version, platform, OS version, and update adoption.

You can install `expo-insights` with:

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo install expo-insights']} />

After you install it and release production builds on the app stores, you'll be able to see additional data on your project dashboard:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Active user insights on the Expo dashboard."
  src="/static/images/monitoring/monitor-your-app/expo-insights.png"
/>

You can learn more about insights with our [EAS Insights guide](/eas-insights/introduction/).

## LogRocket

You can get more insights with [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com). LogRocket records user sessions and identifies bugs as your users use your app. To get started, you can install the LogRocket SDK with the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['npx expo install @logrocket/react-native']} />

Then, in your **app.json**/**app.config.ts**, include the LogRocket config plugin:

```json app.json/app.config.ts
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "android": {
          "minSdkVersion": 25
        }
      }
    ],
    "@logrocket/react-native"
  ]
}
```

Finally, initialize LogRocket in your app in a top-level file, like **app/\_layout.ts** or **App.js**:

```ts app/_layout.ts/App.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
import LogRocket from '@logrocket/react-native';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    LogRocket.init('<App ID>', {
      updateId: Updates.updateId,
    });
  }, []);
};
```

In the code above, replace `<App ID>` with your [LogRocket App ID](https://app.logrocket.com/r/settings/setup).

After you release your app and users start using it, you'll see your users' sessions in the LogRocket dashboard:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="User sessions on the LogRocket dashboard."
  src="/static/images/monitoring/monitor-your-app/logrocket.png"
/>

To learn more about how to use LogRocket with Expo, check out the [LogRocket documentation](https://docs.logrocket.com/reference/react-native-expo-adding-the-sdk).

## More ways to monitor

There are other services you can use to monitor your app, such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com). Check out our guides on how to set up these services with Expo:
