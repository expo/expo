Once your app is released, you can track anonymized usage data to give you insights on how users use your app. This data includes which updates are in use, when users experience bugs, and more.

## EAS Insights

Expo provides the [`expo-insights`](/eas-insights/introduction/) library, which tracks information related to [EAS Update](/deploy/send-over-the-air-updates/). This data includes the app version, platform, OS version, and update adoption. After you install it and release production builds on the app stores, you'll be able to see additional data on your project dashboard:

## LogRocket

You can get more insights with [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com). LogRocket records user sessions and identifies bugs as your users use your app. You can filter sessions by update IDs and also connect to your LogRocket account on the EAS dashboard to get quick access to your app's session data.

## Sentry

[Sentry](http://getsentry.com/) is a crash reporting platform that provides real-time insight into production deployments with information to reproduce and fix crashes.

It notifies you of exceptions or errors that your users run into while using your app and organizes them for you on a web dashboard. Reported exceptions include stacktraces, device info, version, and other relevant context automatically. You can also provide additional context that is specific to your app, such as the current route and user ID.
