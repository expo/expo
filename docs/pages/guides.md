title: Guides to get things done
hideTOC: true
---

In the ['Get Started'](/) section we walk through how you can [install Expo tools](../../get-started/installation/), [create your first app](../../get-started/create-a-new-app/), [guide you through a tutorial](../../tutorial/planning/), and give you a [conceptual overview](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/) of what working with Expo tools looks like, the limitations, and common questions folks have.

The guides section of the documentation is oriented towards getting things done: we explain how to use certain tools and how to perform tasks that you may encounter while building your app. The guides are split up into two main sections: managed workflow and bare workflow.

## Managed workflow

In the managed workflow section we discuss topics as they apply specifically to building a managed workflow project ([what's that?](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/)). Some popular topics include:

- [Expo CLI](../workflow/expo-cli/)
- [Debugging](../workflow/debugging/)
- [iOS Simulator](../workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Android Emulator](../workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [App Icons](../guides/app-icons/)
- [Splash Screens](../guides/splash-screens/)
- [Distributing your App on the App Store and Play Store](../distribution/introduction/)
- [Configuring Over-the-Air Updates](../guides/configuring-ota-updates/)
- [Release Channels](../distribution/release-channels/)
- [Push Notifications](../push-notifications/overview/)
- ....and more. Scroll through the sidebar or press `/` on your keyboard to search the documentation if a particular topic interests you.

## Bare workflow

The bare workflow section provides less guides than are available in the managed workflow currently, there is more to come here in the near future.

- [See a walkthrough of the bare workflow](../bare/unimodules-full-list/)
- [Integrating Expo SDK into an existing React Native app](../bare/existing-apps/)
- [Learn which APIs from the Expo SDK are available in bare React Native apps](../bare/unimodules-full-list/)
- [Using Expo for web](../bare/using-web/)

## Looking for something else?

The [API Reference](../versions/latest/) includes comprehensive documentation around the built-in APIs in the Expo SDK and how to use them.
