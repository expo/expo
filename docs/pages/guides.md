title: Guides to get things done
hideTOC: true
---

In the ['Get Started'](/) section we walk through how you can [install Expo tools](get-started/installation.md), [create your first app](get-started/create-a-new-app.md), [guide you through a tutorial](tutorial/planning.md), and give you a [conceptual overview](introduction/managed-vs-bare.md) of what working with Expo tools looks like, the limitations, and common questions folks have.

The guides section of the documentation is oriented towards getting things done: we explain how to use certain tools and how to perform tasks that you may encounter while building your app. The guides are split up into two main sections: managed workflow and bare workflow.

## Managed workflow

In the managed workflow section we discuss topics as they apply specifically to building a managed workflow project ([what's that?](introduction/managed-vs-bare.md)). Some popular topics include:

- [Expo CLI](workflow/expo-cli.md)
- [Debugging](workflow/debugging.md)
- [iOS Simulator](workflow/ios-simulator.md)
- [Android Emulator](workflow/android-studio-emulator.md)
- [App Icons](guides/app-icons.md)
- [Splash Screens](guides/splash-screens.md)
- [Distributing your App on the App Store and Play Store](distribution/introduction.md)
- [Configuring Over-the-Air Updates](guides/configuring-ota-updates.md)
- [Release Channels](distribution/release-channels.md)
- [Push Notifications](push-notifications/overview.md)
- ....and more. Scroll through the sidebar or press `/` on your keyboard to search the documentation if a particular topic interests you.

## Bare workflow

The bare workflow section provides less guides than are available in the managed workflow currently, there is more to come here in the near future.

- [See a walkthrough of the bare workflow](bare/unimodules-full-list.md)
- [Integrating Expo SDK into an existing React Native app](bare/existing-apps.md)
- [Learn which APIs from the Expo SDK are available in bare React Native apps](bare/unimodules-full-list.md)
- [Using Expo for web](bare/using-web.md)

## Looking for something else?

The [API Reference](../versions/latest/) includes comprehensive documentation around the built-in APIs in the Expo SDK and how to use them.
