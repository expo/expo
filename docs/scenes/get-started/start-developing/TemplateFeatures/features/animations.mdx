<RawH3>Animations</RawH3>

The **src/components/animated-icon.native.tsx** component uses `react-native-reanimated` to create the animated splash overlay and rotating glow effect on native platforms. The web version in **src/components/animated-icon.tsx** uses CSS animations instead, demonstrating platform-specific code using file extensions.
