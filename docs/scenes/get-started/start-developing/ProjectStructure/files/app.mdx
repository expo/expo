Contains the app's navigation, which is file-based. The file structure of the **app** directory determines the app's navigation.

The app has two routes defined by two files: **app/(tabs)/index.tsx** and **app/(tabs)/explore.tsx**. The layout file in **app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx** sets up the tab navigator.
