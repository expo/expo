<RawH3>app</RawH3>

Contains the app's navigation, which is file-based. The file structure of the **src/app** directory determines the app's navigation.

The app has two routes defined by two files: **src/app/index.tsx** and **src/app/explore.tsx**. The layout file in **src/app/\_layout.tsx** sets up the tab navigator using the platform-specific **AppTabs** component.
