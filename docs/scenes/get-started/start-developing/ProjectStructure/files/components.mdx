<RawH3>components</RawH3>

Contains React Native components, like **themed-text.tsx**, which creates text elements that use the app's color scheme in light and dark modes. Some components have platform-specific variants using the **.native.tsx** extension for native and the default **.tsx** for web (for example, **animated-icon.tsx** and **app-tabs.tsx**).
