<RawH3>hooks</RawH3>

Contains [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks), which allows sharing common behavior between components. For example, `useTheme()` is a hook that returns the current theme object and `useColorScheme()` detects the user's color scheme. Some hooks have platform-specific variants using the **.web.ts** extension.
