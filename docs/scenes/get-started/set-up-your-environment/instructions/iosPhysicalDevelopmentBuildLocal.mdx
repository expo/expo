### Plug in your device via USB and enable developer mode

1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB to Lightning cable. Unlock the device and tap **Trust** if prompted.

2. Open Xcode. From the menu bar, select **Window** > **Devices and Simulators**. You will see a warning in Xcode to enable developer mode.

3. On your iOS device, open **Settings** > **Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the **Developer Mode** list item and navigate into it.

4. Tap the switch to enable **Developer Mode**. After you do so, Settings presents an alert to warn you that Developer Mode reduces your device's security. To continue enabling **Developer Mode**, tap the alert's **Restart** button.

5. After the device restarts and you unlock it, the device shows an alert confirming that you want to enable Developer Mode. Tap **Turn On**, and enter your device passcode when prompted.

### Run the project on your device

Run the following command in your project's root directory and select your plugged in device from the list:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo run:ios --device']} />

> This command runs a development server after building your app. You can skip running `npx expo start` on the next page.
