# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npx expo install expo-intent-launcher
```

### Configure for Android

No additional set up necessary.

### Configure for iOS

This package does not make sense on iOS as there is no equivalent API, so it is not supported.
