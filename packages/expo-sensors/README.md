# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sensors/).

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
expo install expo-sensors
```

### Configure for iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package.

**Note:** to access DeviceMotion stats on iOS, the NSMotionUsageDescription key must be present in your Info.plist.

### Configure for Android

No additional set up necessary for basic usage.

**Note:** Starting in Android 12 (API level 31), the system has a 200ms limit for each sensor updates. If you need a update interval less than 200ms, you should add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS"/>` to **AndroidManifest.xml**.
