# expo-branch

## ⚠️ Deprecated

This module will be removed in SDK 46. There will be no replacement that works with the classic build service (`expo build`) because [the classic build service has been superseded by **EAS Build**](https://blog.expo.dev/turtle-goes-out-to-sea-d334db2a6b60). With **EAS Build**, you should use the official [react-native-branch](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/react-native-branch-deep-linking-attribution) library with [@config-plugins/react-native-branch](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins/tree/master/packages/react-native-branch) instead.
