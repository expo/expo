# expo-branch

`expo-branch` is a unimodule wrapper around [`react-native-branch` library](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/react-native-branch-deep-linking-attribution). With custom builds enabled it allows you to optionally include the dependency on Android.

See [Branch docs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/branch) for more information on this module.
