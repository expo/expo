/**
 * A standalone modal component that can be used in Expo Router apps.

 * Internally, the modal is rendered as a `Stack.Screen`, with the presentation style determined by the `presentationStyle` prop.
 *
 * **Props should be set before the modal is opened. Changes to the props will take effect after the modal is reopened.**
 *
 * This component is not linkable. If you need to link to a modal, use `<Stack.Screen options={{ presentationStyle: "modal" }} />` instead.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { Modal } from 'expo-router';
 *
 * function Page() {
 *  const [modalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(false);
 *  return (
 *    <Modal
 *      visible={modalVisible}
 *      onClose={() => setModalVisible(false)}
 *    >
 *      <Text>Hello World</Text>
 *    </Modal>
 *  );
