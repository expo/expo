/**
 * # On iOS:
 * Opens the url with Safari in a modal using `ASWebAuthenticationSession`. The user will be asked
 * whether to allow the app to authenticate using the given url.
 * To handle redirection back to the mobile application, the redirect URI set in the authentication server
 * has to use the protocol provided as the scheme in **app.json** [`expo.scheme`](./../config/app/#scheme)
 * e.g. `demo://` not `https://` protocol.
 * Using `Linking.addEventListener` is not needed and can have side effects.
 *
 * # On Android:
 * This will be done using a "custom Chrome tabs" browser, [AppState](../react-native/appstate/),
 * and [Linking](./linking/) APIs.
 *
 * # On web:
 * > This API can only be used in a secure environment (`https`). You can use expo `start:web --https`
 * to test this. Otherwise, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_CRYPTO`](#errwebbrowsercrypto) will be thrown.
 * This will use the browser's [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) API.
 * - _Desktop_: This will create a new web popup window in the browser that can be closed later using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.
 * - _Mobile_: This will open a new tab in the browser which can be closed using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.
 *
 * How this works on web:
 * - A crypto state will be created for verifying the redirect.
 *   - This means you need to run with `npx expo start --https`
 * - The state will be added to the window's `localstorage`. This ensures that auth cannot complete
 *   unless it's done from a page running with the same origin as it was started.
 *   Ex: if `openAuthSessionAsync` is invoked on `https://localhost:19006`, then `maybeCompleteAuthSession`
 *   must be invoked on a page hosted from the origin `https://localhost:19006`. Using a different
 *   website, or even a different host like `https://128.0.0.*:19006` for example will not work.
 * - A timer will be started to check for every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to detect if the window
 *   has been closed by the user. If this happens then a promise will resolve with `{ type: 'dismiss' }`.
 *
 * > On mobile web, Chrome and Safari will block any call to [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)
 * which takes too long to fire after a user interaction. This method must be invoked immediately
 * after a user interaction. If the event is blocked, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_BLOCKED`](#errwebbrowserblocked) will be thrown.
 *
 * @param url The url to open in the web browser. This should be a login page.
 * @param redirectUrl _Optional_ - The url to deep link back into your app.
 * On web, this defaults to the output of [`Linking.createURL("")`](./linking/#linkingcreateurlpath-namedparameters).
 * @param options _Optional_ - An object extending the [`WebBrowserOpenOptions`](#webbrowseropenoptions).
 * If there is no native AuthSession implementation available (which is the case on Android)
 * these params will be used in the browser polyfill. If there is a native AuthSession implementation,
 * these params will be ignored.
 *
 * @return
 * - If the user does not permit the application to authenticate with the given url, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
 * - If the user closed the web browser, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
 * - If the browser is closed using [`dismissBrowser`](#webbrowserdismissbrowser),
 * the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'dismiss' }` object.

/**

 * @param options
 *
 * @return Returns an object with message about why the redirect failed or succeeded:
 *
 * If `type` is set to `failed`, the reason depends on the message:
 * - `Not supported on this platform`: If the platform doesn't support this method (iOS, Android).
 * - `Cannot use expo-web-browser in a non-browser environment`: If the code was executed in an SSR
 *   or node environment.
 * - `No auth session is currently in progress`: (the cached state wasn't found in local storage).
 *   This can happen if the window redirects to an origin (website) that is different to the initial
 *   website origin. If this happens in development, it may be because the auth started on localhost
 *   and finished on your computer port (Ex: `128.0.0.*`). This is controlled by the `redirectUrl`
 *   and `returnUrl`.
 * - `Current URL "<URL>" and original redirect URL "<URL>" do not match`: This can occur when the
 *   redirect URL doesn't match what was initial defined as the `returnUrl`. You can skip this test
 *   in development by passing `{ skipRedirectCheck: true }` to the function.
 *
 * If `type` is set to `success`, the parent window will attempt to close the child window immediately.
 *
 * If the error `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_REDIRECT` was thrown, it may mean that the parent window was
 * reloaded before the auth was completed. In this case you'll need to close the child window manually.
