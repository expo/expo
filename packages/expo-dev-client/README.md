`expo-dev-client` adds various useful development tools to your debug builds:

- a configurable launcher UI, so you can launch updates (such as from [PR previews](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/development-workflows#pr-previews)) and switch between development servers without needing to recompile the native app
- improved debugging tools (such as support for [inspecting network requests](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/tools/#inspecting-network-requests))
- [a powerful and extensible developer menu UI](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/tools#developer-menu)

Expo documentation refers to debug builds that include `expo-dev-client` as [development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).
