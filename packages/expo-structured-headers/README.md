# expo-structured-headers

Java and Objective-C (partial) implementations of https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html.

The Objective-C implementation only includes the parsing component and does not include serialization. It also ignores ordering of dictionaries.

The Java implementation is a derivative of https://github.com/reschke/structured-fields, with the package name in each source file changed.
