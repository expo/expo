This fixture provides a contrived example template, mostly to help with verifying that [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/tree/master) will resolve different files based on the rename config passed to it.

It's enough for the current tests that we provide just `app.json` (a positive match) and this `README.md` (a negative match).
