 * rejects if it cannot find a reference to the JS runtime. If the promise is rejected in production
 * mode, it most likely means you have installed the module incorrectly. Double check you've
 * followed the installation instructions. In particular, on iOS ensure that you set the `bridge`
 * property on `EXUpdatesAppController` with a pointer to the `RCTBridge` you want to reload, and on
 * Android ensure you either call `UpdatesController.initialize` with the instance of
 * `ReactApplication` you want to reload, or call `UpdatesController.setReactNativeHost` with the
