## 0.3.0 — 2020-08-18

### 🎉 New features

## 0.2.12 — 2020-07-24

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fetch asset manifest through programmatic CLI interface instead of depending on a running React Native CLI server, so `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` works as expected without needing to run `react-native start` beforehand. ([#9372](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9372)).

## 0.2.11 — 2020-06-29

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the publish workflow was broken on Android. Note that the publish workflow will not be supported in a future version of expo-updates, so we recommend [switching to the no-publish workflow](https://blog.expo.io/over-the-air-updates-from-expo-are-now-even-easier-to-use-376e2213fabf).

## 0.2.10 — 2020-06-23

- Improved the error message logged when an embedded manifest cannot be found.

## 0.2.9 — 2020-06-15

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed issue where launch screen on iOS doesn't show whilst updates are being retrieved if it is contained within a storyboard instead of a nib. ([#8750](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8750) by [@MattsTheChief](https://github.com/MattsTheChief))
- Fixed an issue where the REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME env var was not respected in the build scripts for iOS or Android.

- Added a more helpful error message when trying to run a build without the packager server running.

## 0.2.3

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Temporarily vendor `filterPlatformAssetScales` method from `@react-native-community/cli` in order to fix builds when `npm` was used to install dependencies (rather than `yarn`).
- Fixed an issue on iOS where calling the JS module methods in development mode, after publishing at least one update, would crash the app.

## 0.2.2

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue on iOS where expo-updates expected more assets to be embedded than actually are by the React Native CLI.
- Added a better error message on iOS when embedded assets are missing.

## 0.2.1

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Added a better error message to the `createManifest` script when project does not have the `hashAssetFiles` plugin configured.

## 0.2.0

### 🎉 New features

- Added support for the **no-publish workflow**. In this workflow, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update at build-time from the JS code currently on disk, rather than embedding a copy of the most recently published update. For more information, along with upgrade instructions if you're upgrading from 0.1.x and would like to use the no-publish workflow, read [this blog post](https://blog.expo.io/over-the-air-updates-from-expo-are-now-even-easier-to-use-376e2213fabf).
