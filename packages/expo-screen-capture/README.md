# expo-screen-capture

**`expo-screen-capture`** allows you to protect screens in your app from being captured or recorded, as well as be notified if a screenshot is taken while your app is foregrounded. The two most common reasons you may want to prevent screen capture are:

- If a screen is displaying sensitive information (password, credit card data, etc.)
- You are displaying paid content that you don't want recorded and shared

This is especially important on Android, since the [`android.media.projection`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenCapture) API allows third-party apps to perform screen capture or screen sharing (even if the app is backgrounded).

> Currently, taking screenshots on iOS cannot be prevented. This is due to underlying OS limitations.
