# expo-navigation-bar

**`expo-navigation-bar`** enables you to modify and observe the native navigation bar on Android devices. Due to some Android platform restrictions, parts of this API overlap with the [`expo-status-bar`][status-bar] API.

Properties are named after style properties; visibility, position, backgroundColor, borderColor, etc.
