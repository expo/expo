 * purchase listener globally**, and not inside a specific screen, to ensure that you receive

 *
 * Purchases can either be instantiated by the user (via `purchaseItemAsync`) or they can come from
 * subscription renewals or unfinished transactions on iOS (e.g. if your app exits before
 * `finishTransactionAsync` was called).
 *
 * Note that on iOS, the results array will only contain one item: the one that was just
 * purchased. On Android, it will return both finished and unfinished purchases, hence the array
 * return type. This is because the Google Play Billing API detects purchase updates but doesn't
 * differentiate which item was just purchased, therefore there's no good way to tell but in general
 * it will be whichever purchase has `acknowledged` set to `false`, so those are the ones that you
 * have to handle in the response. Consumed items will not be returned however, so if you consume an
 * item that record will be gone and no longer appear in the results array when a new purchase is
 * made.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Set purchase listener
 *  setPurchaseListener(({ responseCode, results, errorCode }) => {

 * Marks a transaction as completed. This _must_ be called on successful purchases only after you
 * have verified the transaction and unlocked the functionality purchased by the user.
 *
 * On Android, this will either "acknowledge" or "consume" the purchase depending on the value of
 * `consumeItem`. Acknowledging indicates that this is a one time purchase (e.g. premium upgrade),
 * whereas consuming a purchase allows it to be bought more than once. You cannot buy an item again
 * until it's consumed. Both consuming and acknowledging let Google know that you are done
 * processing the transaction. If you do not acknowledge or consume a purchase within three days,
 * the user automatically receives a refund, and Google Play revokes the purchase.
 *
 * On iOS, this will [mark the transaction as
 * finished](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/1506003-finishtransaction)
 * and prevent it from reappearing in the purchase listener callback. It will also let the user know
 * their purchase was successful.
