/**
 * Starts a new imperative listener for cli plugins. This is an alternative to the useDevToolsPlugin
 * hook that is used with devtools. This function is used to avoid having the user to use the hook,
 * and to be able to imperatively communicate over the web socket connections with running apps.
 * We should not run these if we are in production - but we should run in development
 * and when in a development client built in release mode with EAS. This is tested using the
 * ´globalThis.expo.modules.EXDevLauncher !== undefined´ expression.
 * @returns
