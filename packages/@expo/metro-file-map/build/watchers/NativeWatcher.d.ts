/**
 * NativeWatcher uses Node's native fs.watch API with recursive: true.
 *
 * Supported on macOS (and potentially Windows), because both natively have a
 * concept of recurisve watching, via FSEvents and ReadDirectoryChangesW
 * respectively. Notably Linux lacks this capability at the OS level.
 *
 * Node.js has at times supported the `recursive` option to fs.watch on Linux
 * by walking the directory tree and creating a watcher on each directory, but
 * this fits poorly with the synchronous `watch` API - either it must block for
 * arbitrarily large IO, or it may drop changes after `watch` returns. See:
 * https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/48437
 *
 * Therefore, we retain a fallback to our own application-level recursive
 * FallbackWatcher for Linux, which has async `startWatching`.
 *
 * On Windows, this watcher could be used in principle, but needs work around
 * some Windows-specific edge cases handled in FallbackWatcher, like
 * deduping file change events, ignoring directory changes, and handling EPERM.
