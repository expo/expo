It makes\n * single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to\n * recognize simple multi-touch gestures.\n *\n * By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block\n * long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.\n *\n * It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the\n * [gesture responder system](docs/gesture-responder-system.html).\n * For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the\n * native event object:\n *\n * ```\n * onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}\n * ```\n *\n * A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:\n *\n *  - `nativeEvent`\n *      + `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event\n *      + `identifier` - The ID of the touch\n *      + `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element\n *      + `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element\n *      + `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event\n *      + `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation\n *      + `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen\n *\n * A `gestureState` object has the following:\n *\n *  - `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least\n *     one touch on screen\n *  - `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch\n *  - `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant\n *  - `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started\n *  - `vx` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `vy` - current velocity of the gesture\n *  - `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen\n *\n * ### Basic Usage\n *\n * ```\n *   componentWillMount: function() {\n *     this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({\n *       // Ask to be the responder:\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *\n *       onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows\n *         // what is happening!\n *\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}\n *\n *         // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is\n *         // gestureState.d{x,y}\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n *       onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // The user has released all touches while this view is the\n *         // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded\n *       },\n *       onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture\n *         // should be cancelled\n *       },\n *       onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {\n *         // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS\n *         // responder.

If\n   * two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other\n   * touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.\n   *\n   * This logic requires a kind of processing of time \"clusters\" of touch events\n   * so that two touch moves that essentially occur in parallel but move every\n   * other frame respectively, are considered part of the same movement.\n   *\n   * Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:\n   *\n   * - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is\n   *   invalid.

If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance.
