/**
 * Gets the advertising ID, a UUID string intended only for advertising. Use this string for
 * frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users,
 * advertising fraud detection, and debugging.
 *
 * As a best practice, don't store the advertising ID. Instead, call this function each time your
 * app needs to use the advertising ID. Users can change whether they allow app tracking and can
 * reset their advertising ID at any time in their system settings. Check your app's authorization
 * using `getTrackingPermissionsAsync()` to determine the user's intent.
 *
 * On Android, this function returns the "Android Advertising ID"
 * ([AAID](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid)).
 * On Android devices that support multiple users, including guest users, it's possible for your app
 * to obtain different advertising IDs on the same device. These different IDs correspond to
 * different users who could be signed in on that device. See Google's documentation for more
 * information: [Get a user-resettable advertising
 * ID](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/ad-id).
 *
 * On iOS, this function returns the "Identifier for Advertisers"
 * ([IDFA](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/advertisingidentifier)),
 * a string that's unique to each device. On devices running iOS 14.5 and newer, your app must
 * request tracking authorization using `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()` before it can get the
 * advertising identifier.
 *
 * @return Returns either a UUID `string` or `null`. It returns null in the following cases:
 * - On Android, when `isLimitAdTrackingEnabled()` is `true`
 * - In the iOS simulator, regardless of any settings
 * - On devices running iOS 14.5 and later if you haven't received permission using
 *   `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`
 * - On iOS, if you've requested permission and the user declines
 * - On iOS, when a profile or configuration restricts access to the advertising identifier, such as
 *   when the user has turned off the system-wide "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * TrackingTransparency.getAdvertisingId();
 * // "E9228286-4C4E-4789-9D95-15827DCB291B"
 * ```
