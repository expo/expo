/** \class SkPath
    SkPath contain geometry. SkPath may be empty, or contain one or more verbs that
    outline a figure. SkPath always starts with a move verb to a Cartesian coordinate,
    and may be followed by additional verbs that add lines or curves.
    Adding a close verb makes the geometry into a continuous loop, a closed contour.
    SkPath may contain any number of contours, each beginning with a move verb.

    SkPath contours may contain only a move verb, or may also contain lines,
    quadratic beziers, conics, and cubic beziers. SkPath contours may be open or
    closed.

    When used to draw a filled area, SkPath describes whether the fill is inside or
    outside the geometry. SkPath also describes the winding rule used to fill
    overlapping contours.

    Internally, SkPath lazily computes metrics likes bounds and convexity. Call
    SkPath::updateBoundsCache to make SkPath thread safe.
