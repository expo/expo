/** \class SkImage
    SkImage describes a two dimensional array of pixels to draw. The pixels may be
    decoded in a raster bitmap, encoded in a SkPicture or compressed data stream,
    or located in GPU memory as a GPU texture.

    SkImage cannot be modified after it is created. SkImage may allocate additional
    storage as needed; for instance, an encoded SkImage may decode when drawn.

    SkImage width and height are greater than zero. Creating an SkImage with zero width
    or height returns SkImage equal to nullptr.

    SkImage may be created from SkBitmap, SkPixmap, SkSurface, SkPicture, encoded streams,
    GPU texture, YUV_ColorSpace data, or hardware buffer. Encoded streams supported
    include BMP, GIF, HEIF, ICO, JPEG, PNG, WBMP, WebP. Supported encoding details
    vary with platform.

        and uploads if necessary. The returned SkImage respects the required image properties'
        mipmap setting for non-Graphite SkImages; i.e., if mipmapping is required, the backing
        Graphite texture will have allocated mip map levels.

        It is assumed that MIP maps are always supported by the GPU.

        is compatible with the backing Graphite texture. If the required mipmapping is not
        compatible, nullptr will be returned.

        Returns nullptr if no Recorder is provided, or if SkImage was created with another
        Recorder and work on that Recorder has not been submitted.
