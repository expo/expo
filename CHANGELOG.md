  - When migrating installation identifier (used internally to fetch Expo push token) `expo-notifications` will now remove existing `SharedPreferences` entry, if the migrated identifier comes from there.

If you do not upgrade `expo-constants`, its `.installationId` may change.** ([#11283](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11283) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela)) ([#11283](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/11283) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

If you would like to collect the IDFA, you must be in the bare workflow. ([#9880](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9880) by [@bbarthec](https://github.com/bbarthec))
  - Renamed all methods to include the 'Async' suffix:
  - All methods now return a Promise. ([#9212](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9212/) by [@cruzach](https://github.com/cruzach))

Previously it was the contents of remote notification payload with all entries from under `"body"` moved from under `"body"` to root level. Now it's the sole unchanged contents of `payload["body"]`. Other fields of the payload can now be accessed on iOS through `PushNotificationTrigger.payload` (similarly to how other fields of native remote message can be accessed on Android under `PushNotificationTrigger.remoteMessage`).

  - Changed how you can override ways in which a notification is reinterpreted from a [`StatusBarNotification`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/StatusBarNotification) and in which a [`Notification`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html?hl=en) is built from defining an `expo.modules.notifications#NotificationsScoper` meta-data value in `AndroidManifest.xml` to implementing a `BroadcastReceiver` subclassing `NotificationsService` delegating those responsibilities to your custom `PresentationDelegate` instance. ([#10558](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10558) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela))

- **`expo-analytics-segment`**
  - Upgraded Segment Analytics iOS to 4.0.4. **This removes the IDFA code that was previously included with the Segment library.** If you would like to collect the IDFA, you must be in the bare workflow or use SDK < 39.

  - Made type and enum names more consistent and in line with our standards — they all are now prefixed by `Location`.

### 🛠 Breaking changes

- **Android push notifications:** your Google API key specified in `google-services.json` must allow access to the Cloud Messaging API if you have restricted your API key to access only specific APIs. In the Google Cloud console, browse to [APIs & Services -> Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Find the API key that is associated with your app and click the pencil icon to edit it. Under "API restrictions", if the key is restricted, add "Firebase Installations API" and "Cloud Messaging" to the set of allowed APIs and save the changes. (Technical note: Google changed the underlying Firebase Cloud Messaging library in `com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.1.2` to depend on the Firebase Installations API, which applies API key restrictions. See Google's notes [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#2020-02-27) and [here](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/blob/master/firebase-installations/API_KEY_RESTRICTIONS.md).)

## 32.0.0

### 🛠 Breaking changes

- deprecated `import { Font } from 'expo-font'` in favor of individually named exports (`import * as Font from expo-font`) for better dead-export elimination potential. Upgrade `@expo/vector-icons` if you get a warning about this. By [@ide](https://github.com/ide) ([`264c17cd`](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/264c17cdb175021c7fd16bb461652b8ab6cb2fda))

- removed deprecated support for passing an array into `Font.loadAsync`. This feature displayed a deprecation warning for several SDK versions so if you didn't see it, this change shouldn't affect you.
- deprecated `enableHighAccuracy` option in `Location` module in favor of `accuracy` which gives much more options by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta) ([#2338](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/2338))

- removed `minSdk` application flavor from Android project (all Gradle commands in format `[verb][minSdkFlavor]minSdk[remoteKernelFlavor]Kernel[buildType]`, eg. `assembleDevMinSdkDevKernelDebug` become `[verb][remoteKernelFlavor]Kernel[buildType]`, eg. `assembleDevKernelDebug`) by [@sjchmiela](https://github.com/sjchmiela) ([`3b5e158`](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/3b5e1583ecc210ee36b9d5772d2d7c35a6315500))
