/**
 ABI44_0_0RCTRequired<T> uses the compiler to enforce definition of a struct member (primitives, pointers, or objects).

 Internally, we use an implicit constructor without a default, so there has to be an initial value.

 Usage:
 @code
 struct S {
 ABI44_0_0RCTRequired<int> i;
 ABI44_0_0RCTRequired<NSString *> str;
 NSString *optionalStr;
 };

 S options = {
 .i = 0,                // warning if omitted
 .str = @"Hello World", // warning if omitted
 };
 @endcode
