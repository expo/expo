 * This class overrides the `delegate` property and wires that to the delegate splitter.
 *
 * We never know which another part of the app might introspect the view hierarchy and mess with `UIScrollView`'s
 * delegate, so we expose a fake delegate connected to the original one via the splitter to make the component as
 * resilient to other code as possible: even if something else nil the delegate, other delegates that were subscribed
 * via the splitter will continue working.
