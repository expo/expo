// HACK: When uploading images/video from PHAssetLibrary, we change the URL scheme to be
// ph-upload://. This is to ensure that we upload a full video when given a ph-upload:// URL,
// instead of just the thumbnail. Consider the following problem:
// The user has a video in their camera roll with URL ph://1B3E2DDB-0AD3-4E33-A7A1-9F4AA9A762AA/L0/001
// 1. We want to display that video in an <Image> and show the thumbnail
// 2. We later want to upload that video.
// At this point, if we use the same URL for both uses, there is no way to distinguish the intent
// and we will either upload the thumbnail (bad!) or try to show the video in an <Image> (bad!).
// Our solution is to change the URL scheme in the uploader.
