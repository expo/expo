/**
 * MapBuffer is an optimized map format for transferring data like props between
 * C++ and other platforms The implementation of this map is optimized to:
 * - be compact to optimize space when sparse (sparse is the common case).
 * - be accessible through JNI with zero/minimal copying via ByteBuffer.
 * - be Have excellent C++ single-write and many-read performance by maximizing
 *   CPU cache performance through compactness, data locality, and fixed offsets
 *   where possible.
 * - be optimized for iteration and intersection against other maps, but with
 *   reasonably good random access as well.
 * - Work recursively for nested maps/arrays.
 * - Supports dynamic types that map to JSON.
 * - Don't require mutability - single-write on creation.
 * - have minimal APK size and build time impact.
