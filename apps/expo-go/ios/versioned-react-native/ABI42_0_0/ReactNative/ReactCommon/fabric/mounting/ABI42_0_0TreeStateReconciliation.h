/**
 * Problem Description: because of C++ State, the ABI42_0_0React Native C++ ShadowTree
 * can diverge from the ABI42_0_0ReactJS ShadowTree; ABI42_0_0ReactJS communicates all tree
 * changes to C++, but C++ state commits are not propagated to ABI42_0_0ReactJS (ABI42_0_0ReactJS
 * may or may not clone nodes with state changes, but it has no way of knowing
 * if it /should/ clone those nodes; so those clones may never happen). This
 * causes a number of problems. This function resolves the problem by taking a
 * candidate tree being committed, and sees if any State changes need to be
 * applied to it. If any changes need to be made, a new ShadowNode is returned;
 * otherwise, nullptr is returned if the node is already consistent with the
 * latest tree, including all state changes.
 *
 * This should be called during the commit phase, pre-layout and pre-diff.
