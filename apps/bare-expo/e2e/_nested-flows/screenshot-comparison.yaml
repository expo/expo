# Screenshot comparison flow for maestro
# This flow can be reused across different image comparison tests
# it fails if the images are too different

# making changes? update apps/bare-expo/scripts/lib/pathUtils.test.ts

# Parameters:
#   - screenshotOutputPath: The path including the name of the screenshot to take and compare
#   - similarityThreshold: The percentage of similarity required to pass the comparison (default: <=5% difference)
#   - resizingFactor: this factor resizes the taken images to occupy less space
