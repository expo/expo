# view shot comparison flow for maestro
# This flow can be reused across different view shot comparison tests
# it fails if the images are too different, optionally normalizing images so that only one view shot is used for both platforms

# making changes? update apps/bare-expo/scripts/lib/pathUtils.test.ts

# Parameters:
#   - screenshotOutputPath: The folder path of the viewshot to take and compare. The file name will be based on the testID
#   - testID: The testID of the view to take shot of
#   - mode: 'crossPlatform' or 'platformDependent'. When 'crossPlatform', the view shot will be normalized before compared with the base view shot
#   - similarityThreshold: The percentage of similarity required to pass the comparison. Defaults to 5 and 15% for the platformDependent and crossPlatform modes, respectively
