TODO(vonovak,20250122) - Remove the node_modules folder and gitignore when https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/48574 is out.

This is a temporary fix for Expo Go. Hermes podspec is not resolving `react-native` path to the one we have inside `react-native-lab` but instead resolves to root `node_modules/react-native`.

This is because `require.resolve` traverses up from the podspec file and the first `react-native` it finds is in the root node modules. We place one more `node_modules` on the path to capture that traversal and redirect by symlink to `react-native-lab`.
