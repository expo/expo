As it's prone to errors due to its complexity and the fact it sometimes may take some time, we made it stateful.
It's been splitted into a few tasks after each a backup is saved under ${chalk.magenta.bold(path.relative(EXPO_DIR, BACKUP_PATH))} file
and all file changes they made are added to Git's index as part of the backup. Due to its stateful nature,
your local repo must be clear (without unstaged changes) and you shouldn't make any changes in the repo while the command is running.

In case of any errors or mistakes you can always go back to the previous phase by running the exact same command again,
but remember to leave staged changes as they were because they're also part of the backup.`
