# Github workflows need to exist on the 'main' branch
# in order to be run on other branches using workflow_dispatch.
# The actual workflow is loaded from the target branch
# (the one we dispatch the workflow to run on)
# so we need a minimal failing job on main just to be able
# to trigger the workflow on other (usually sdk-xx) branches
