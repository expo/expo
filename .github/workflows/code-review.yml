      ### This job is run on Ubuntu which doesn't have SwiftLint installed, so we need to build it from sources.
      ### Building it on each run may take too much time, so we bundle the binary in `@expo/swiftlint` package.
      ### To update SwiftLint, uncomment steps below, download the artifact and update that package.
