        This should include as little code as possible, and no extraneous dependencies. Do not share your entire project. If a reproducible demo is not provided, your issue will be closed. 
        If you link to a project that contains multiple non-Expo-core modules, it is unlikely to help us narrow down the cause of your issue more quickly.
