      label: Summary
      description: |
        Clearly describe what the expected behavior is vs. what is actually happening. This should be as short as possible, while still communicating all the necessary information.
        If your summary is simply, for example: "My device cannot connect to Wi-Fi.", then you will need to [continue debugging on your own](https://expo.fyi/manual-debugging) to more precisely define your issue before proceeding.

      label: Minimal reproducible example
      description: |
        A link to a GitHub repository containing a minimal reproducible example. This repository should include as little code as possible and not include extraneous dependencies. The most effective reproducible examples are created by starting a new project from scratch and adding in only the necessary pieces to reproduce the issue. Do not share your entire project.
        List the steps you took to generate the reproducible example within that repository in the README or the summary field below along with any instructions needed to run the project.
        You must also test your issue against the latest CLI version to ensure that it hasn't already been resolved.
        If a reproducible example is not provided, your issue will be closed.

        **Realize that it is up to you to debug your code and be as certain as possible that the bug is with Expo, not with your own app.**
